      " NCLT and SEBI at Loggerheads over Attachment of Ponzi Debtor's Properties The principal bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has directed market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to de-attach the properties of a corporate debtor attached during its execution proceedings. The matter brings into focus the issue of the in-built disagreement between the SEBI Act and the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Especially, how a corporate debtor that was operating as an illegal collective investment scheme (CIS) can be revived under the IBC. Was it due to inactiveness of SEBI to act on  orders of SAT (securities appellate tribunal) to sell assets of the debtor in timely manner? \n",

      " MUMBAI: The Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) directed the National Stock Exchange ( NSE ) to pay Rs 687 crore and barred it from accessing the securities market for six months following investigations into the colocation of servers that gave an unfair advantage to some traders.The regulator also banned former NSE chief executives Ravi Narain and Chitra Ramkrishna from associating with any listed company or stock exchange for five years for their alleged role in the matter.The regulator said high-profile academic Ajay Shah was also prohibited from associating in any manner with any stock exchange, depository, market intermediary or listed company for two years. It also barred stock broker OPG Securities and its directors Sanjay Gupta and Sangeeta Gupta from accessing the securities market for five years.The case dates back to 2015, when a whistleblower wrote a letter to Sebi alleging that NSE, India's largest stock exchange, gave preferential access to a few high-frequency traders and brokers to the exchange's trading platform. Sebi named the complainant as Ken Fong.Colocation refers to traders being able to place servers in close proximity to those of an exchange, thus giving them a time advantage that translates into massive profits.Along with interest, the penalty on NSE will likely add up to over Rs 1,000 crore. NSE's reserves and surplus as on March 2018 was Rs 7,225 crore.Narain and Ramkrishna also have to return a fourth of their NSE salary for FY2011-13 and FY14, in that order, corresponding to the years in which they were in charge. All the money will go to Sebi's Investor Protection and Education Fund (IPEF).Ravi Varanasi, head of business development, and Suprabhat Lala, assistant vice president, have been barred from holding any position with any stock exchange for three and two years, respectively.\"I find that it is established beyond doubt that NSE has not exercised the requisite due diligence while putting in place the TBT (tick-by-tick) architecture,\" Sebi whole-time member G Mahalingam said in his 104-page order. \"The same created a trading environment in which the information dissemination was asymmetric, which cannot be considered fair and equitable.\"Narain and Ramkrishna held the post of managing director and chief executive officer (MD & CEO) of NSE in succession.\"Having held the senior-most management position in the NSE and being in charge of the affairs of the conduct of the stock exchange business, they cannot limit their roles to the non-technology issues of the exchange,\" Sebi said. \"The MD and CEO of a stock exchange cannot abdicate his/ her responsibility by citing limited knowledge in certain spheres of the business activities.\"The regulator dropped allegations of fraudulent and unfair trade practices that it had levelled against the exchange and its employees.Responding to ET’s queries on the development, NSE CEO Vikram Limaye said: \"We will take appropriate legal advice on all these matters and then we will take appropriate action.\"On the exchange’s IPO plans he said: \"They have said that we cannot access the markets for six months. The IPO can't happen for six months, but after that obviously the implication of this order is that they will not hold up the IPO \n",

      " So it is something that we will look into now that we have a final order. Till this point in time, we have a letter from the Sebi that says that we cannot file a DRHP till this matter is resolved.\"Sebi passed five separate orders on the colocation case against the NSE, OPG Securities, Ajay Shah, Sampark Infotainment and NSE’s corporate governance on Tuesday.The regulator’s main allegation against NSE was that its tick-by-tick system was prone to manipulation, which compromised market fairness and integrity. It allegedly failed to put in place a ‘randomiser’ that have helped avoid misuse. Sebi also said that NSE failed to implement a load balancer, which put members who were on more crowded ports at a disadvantage and provided an unfair advantage to those on less crowded ones.NSE allegedly did not have defined policies and procedures with regard to secondary server access, and the guidelines were not issued as a circular.\"By selectively reprimanding some brokers connecting to the secondary servers (and not others), and allowing some brokers to continue connecting regularly to the secondary servers, NSE allegedly showed differential treatment to brokers,\" the regulator said in its order.The regulator alleged that OPG Securities gained an advantage over other members by consistently connecting to the tick-by-tick servers first.\"OPG Securities would allegedly regularly connect to the secondary server, and the noticee (NSE) took no action to prevent this despite having knowledge of this,\" Sebi said.It gained an advantage by hiring an employee of Omnesys Technologies, in which NSE was the second-largest shareholder.\"OPG used the NSE system to its advantage by (a) hiring Mr Nagbhusan Bhat, who was working with Omnesys to figure out which server was working better; (b) having certain arrangements with NSE’s datacenter staff named Jagdish Joshi who would inform the TM(s) the time when the servers would start, and therefore could be the first to connect; (c) switching on to the fastest servers or accessing least crowded servers with the help of NSE staff members,\" Sebi said in its background to the case. \"It was alleged that OPG indulged in front-running in collaboration with NSE employees.\"OPG was also allowed to access the backup servers, it said. The management of the NSE was allegedly in denial mode and had not acted on the complaints forwarded to it, Sebi said.The regulator also said Ajay Shah, Infotech Financial Services, Krishna Dagli, Sunita Thomas and Suprabhat Lala were connected persons.Sunita Thomas, who is the director of Infotech, is the wife of Suprabhat Lala of NSE. Ajay Shah is the husband of the sister of Sunita Thomas. Sebi alleged that there was an inherent conflict of interest in NSE in giving the liquidity Index contract to Infotech by overlooking its own subsidiary which is engaged in similar activity.Sebi’s investigation revealed that the trading data that was received by Infotech from NSE for research in the liquidity index project was being misused for developing algorithm trading products.\"Suprabhat Lala being a senior official of NSE ought to have displayed professional integrity by disclosing to the senior management his connection with Infotech Financial Services through his wife Sunita Thomas which had a strong cause to give rise to a conflict of interest to him as well as to Ajay Shah,\" the Sebi order said.\"However, when a data-sharing agreement purely meant for research purposes assumes the colour of a commercial agreement, thereby providing privileged access to confidential and exclusive trade data of the exchange to a select few persons who clandestinely exploit the said data for their commercial gains, it leads to serious issues leading to compromise on market integrity,\" the regulator said. \n",

Also, Dhoot continues to hold interest in NuPower through debentures of Rs 64 crore, subscribed through Supreme Energy, the regulator found.Association of Deepak Kocchar and Videocon has also been confirmed in case of Credential Finance.On the basis of the preliminary report, Sebi has concluded that there was conflict of interest in the transactions of ICICI Bank with Videocon.By not disclosing the details of her husband's dealings with Videocon, Kochhar has not complied with the provisions of listing agreement. Further, the bank also failed in ensuring that its directors comply with listing rules, the official said.Therefore, adjudication proceedings have been recommended against ICICI Bank and Kochhar, he added.Last week, Sebi Chairman Ajay Tyagi had said the regulator was yet to receive a reply from ICICI Bank on the allegations involving Kochhar.The cases under scanner include the bank's Rs 3,250 crore loan to Videocon Group in 2012 and the involvement of Kochhar's family members in restructuring of the loan.Kochhar and her family members are facing allegations of quid pro quo and conflict of interest with respect to a loan extended to certain entities. \n",

People in Bombay have been unquestionably responding to the direction from Delhi,\" Damodaran said told the students of the RBI-run National Institute of Bank Management here today on their convocation.Defending public sector banks, he said privatisation cannot be the solution for all the bad loans issues they face and blamed their peculiar governance and ownership issues for the problems they face.\"I am not arguing that we should privatise everything because we've very recent evidences that privatisation is not a synonym for honesty or efficiency or to avoid conflict of interest,\" he said.It can be noted that large private sector banks ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are steeped in controversies due to weak corporate governance practices.While ICICI Bank is embroiled in a controversy over the alleged conflict of interest involving its chief executive Chanda Kochhar and the business dealings of her husband Deepak Kochhar with the Videocon group, Axis Bank saw the tenure of its chief Shikha Sharma being cut to seven months from a three year-term after being nudged by the Reserve Bank in the wake of high bad loans which have grown more than fivefold during her tenure.\"The answer does not lie in privatisation \n",

It also gives them the advantage of cutting down on ancillary costs and reducing the paperwork involved in raising money. \n",

      " MUMBAI: A whistle-blower had reached out to the market regulator alleging a number of irregularities at Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, reports said a day after ET reported that Australian brokerage Macquarie had raised concern over corporate governance practices at India’s largest drug maker.Online publication Moneylife.in reported on Friday that a senior executive of Sun Pharma had submitted a 150-page document to the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) in September alleging insider trading by the company through several foreign entities. These included Bomin Finance, First International Group Plc, Orbit Investments Plc, Sun Global Investments, Orange Mauritius Investments, Hypnos Fund Limited, Elm Park Fund, Asia Advantage Fund and ITF Mauritius, according to the report.“We have not been contacted by SEBI in this regard,” Sun Pharma said in an emailed reply to a query from ET on whether the company was aware of the allegations made by the whistle-blower. Queries emailed by ET to SEBI did not elicit any response until late evening on Friday.On Wednesday, Sun Pharma’s shares had plunged to a six-month low after a sales note by Macquarie – with the subject line, ‘Murky Waters of Sun Pharma’ – had gone viral on WhatsApp , triggering alarm among investors . The note raised questions on inadequate disclosure norms in the company with regard to related party transactions, issues of conflict of interest of Sudhir Valia, whole-time director, Sun Pharma, and the company’s links in the past with banned traders such as Ketan Parekh and Dharmesh Doshi.“There are number of red flags we have observed over the years in Sun Pharma. Most of these the street has already picked up on including a sole distributor for Sun Pharma that is wholly owned by the promoter; the company’s conspicuously low tax rate (used to be as low as 3%) and the guarantees that Sun Pharma had made to a number of entities (including Suraksha realty, a company promoted by Sudhir Valia),” the Macquarie note said.On Thursday, Sun Pharma told ET and the stock exchanges separately that it was legally compliant with all the disclosure norms of SEBI \n",

      " Mumbai: The capital markets regulator has directed HDFC Asset Management, the country’s second-largest fund house, to scrap a share placement to top financial advisers and distributors ahead of its initial public offering . Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) has asked the fund house to return the money it had collected from these advisers and distributors at 12 per cent, said three people privy to the development.According to sources, HDFC AMC could get the final approval for the IPO once this refund is completed.HDFC Asset Management sold shares worth almost Rs 150 crore to distributors in April this year. These shares were offered to 190 leading distributors and advisers at Rs 1,050 per share. Of these, 140 subscribed, according to market sources.This was the first time a mutual fund has offered its shares to a clutch of distributors. The move, however, did not go down well with those left out, prompting a complaint to Sebi.“This is against the law. This practice is against the spirit of MF regulations itself,” a senior Sebi official said on the development.Phone calls and text messages sent to HDFC Asset Management’s spokesperson seeking its response on the issue went unanswered at the time of going to press.Two independent financial advisers (IFAs) who were allotted shares in the private placement confirmed that HDFC AMC is cancelling the pre-IPO share sale.HDFC Asset Management had filed papers with Sebi in March for an IPO \n",

      " But it had to put the listing plans on hold after the regulator deferred approval for the IPO.Prior to the controversial share allotment, HDFC AMC had sought approval for a special quota for distributors in its IPO. The fund house said in its draft red herring prospectus that it may set aside up to 7.2 lakh shares for distributors, subject to regulatory approvals. Sebi, however, rejected the proposal then because it was against a separate quota for distributors. HDFC AMC then issued the shares via private placement, which Sebi now also considers a violation.Officials at rival mutual funds said private placements by asset managers to distributors and financial advisers could lead to ‘conflict of interest’.“Distributors are supposed to advise investors as per the performance of the fund. Such incentives could lead to distributors favouring mutual funds that hand over the highest number of shares to them. That is not a good practice,” said the chief executive of a large rival mutual fund. \n",

      " MUMBAI: The spate of auditor resignations from companies in last few weeks and questions raised over certain transactions could lead to the securities and banking regulators scrutinising the transactions as these happened through banking channels, said two persons in the know.In most resignations, the reasons provided mainly involve intergroup transactions and bank loans raised for one purpose but used for another.The allegations are that promoters moved money from one entity to another— through banking channels— without providing documentary evidence to support these. The question is how could banks not know of these dodgy transactions or did they deliberately overlook them, asked one of the persons in the know.“The wider problem is that there have been significant transactions where recoverability is doubtful. A bank has a right to recall a loan if there are early warning signals like the auditor resignations, what are they doing about that?” asked the other person close to the development.Both Reserve Bank of India RBI ) and Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) may start a separate investigations and look into these transactions, sources said.Price Waterhouse & Co Chartered Accountants LLP, a network firm of PwC India, resigned a few days ago as an auditor of BSE-listed Eveready Industries India (EIIL) citing a few transactions relating to intercompany deposits. The resignation in EIIL came weeks after PwC resigned as auditor of Reliance Capital and Reliance Home Finance. PwC had not gone into the specifics but hinted at certain transactions involving group companies.“The biggest issue with the earlier NPA (non-performing asset) problem was that banks ignored the early warnings and did not categorise these as one \n",

      " A few days ago, the Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) asked HDFC Asset Management Company Ltd, (HDFC AMC) to cancel the Rs150-crore private placement made to 140 of their privileged distributors, in April 2018, ahead of its initial public offering (IPO). The shares were offered to these distributors at Rs1,050 each, while the price band for the forthcoming IPO is Rs1,400-1,500, giving them a huge profit on subscription. The issue here was creating a conflict of interest. The distributors were seen to be influenced into give a preference to HDFC Mutual Fund’s schemes over those of others which is detrimental to investor interest—a far from ‘saahi’ action.

Further, not more than 15% of the Net Offer shall be available for allocation on a proportionate basis to Non-Institutional Bidders and not more than 10% of the Net Offer shall be available for allocation on a proportionate basis to Retail Individual Bidders in accordance with the SEBI ICDR Regulations, subject to valid Bids being received at or above the Offer Price. In the event we fail to do so, the full application money shall be refunded to the Bidders. (emphasis added). Hence, we are eligible for the Offer under Regulation 26(2) of the SEBI ICDR Regulations.

      " A speech made last week by Viral Acharya , the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has brought the tensions between the RBI and the government to the forefront. Stressing the importance of the central bank's autonomy, Acharya sounded a warning to the government — keep your hands off the RBI. However, the rift between the government and the RBI, especially its Governor Urjit Patel , has widened over several past months as both increasingly differed on key issues.According to a TOI report, there has been an almost complete breakdown in communication between the government and RBI. The tension has triggered fevered speculation about Patel’s fate. Not only does he appear highly unlikely to get an extension beyond the three-year term that ends next September, questions have arisen over his continuance, according to the report. Patel did not respond to a message from TOI. Some people in the NDA government have gone so far as to acknowledge in private that “even Raghuram Rajan was better than this” — and Patel’s predecessor didn’t leave on the best of terms, says the report.In 2018, the RBI and the government developed differences over at least six major issues:The spat began with the government unhappy with the inflation-focused RBI for not cutting interest rates – and even raising them. However, it spilled over into regulation, something the central bank believes is its exclusive domain \n",

      " What followed was a host of issues related to regulation where both the parties asserted against each other.RBI’s February 12 circular on classification of non-performing assets (NPAs) and norms of loan restructuring was the next flashpoint. The government saw it as overly harsh, and indeed it drove all but two state-run lenders into the red.Around the same time, as the Nirav Modi scam broke, the government hit out at the RBI on supervision, drawing an almost-immediate rebuttal with Patel seeking more powers to oversee public sector banks so that they are at par with their private sector peers.The government has been insisting that RBI step in to provide relief to non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), which are grappling with a cash crunch after IL&FS defaulted on repayments. The central bank has refused to play ball.In September, Nachiket Mor was removed from the RBI board more than two years before his term was to end without formally informing him. This irked the central bank brass. His removal was seen to be linked to his vocal opposition to the government's demand for a higher dividend.A separate payments regulator has been another friction point with RBI stating its position publicly on why it did not support the move. In fact, it went to the extent of releasing its dissent note on a separate regulator on its website.However, the government does not see the whole issue as jousting between both the parties. TOI reports that people in the government said the tension should not be seen through a government versus regulator prism. They argued that the onus of taking the board along rests with the governor.

      " The decision of the central board of the Reserve Bank of India to transfer an interim surplus of ₹28,000 crore to the Centre should come as a big relief to the Modi government. Together with the ₹40,000-crore final surplus share for 2017-18, which the Centre received in the first half, the total receipts from the RBI this fiscal will be a tidy ₹68,000 crore. For a government strapped for finances and struggling to meet the revised fiscal deficit target of 3.4% of GDP, the RBI’s largesse will be handy. The total surplus received by the Centre for 2018-19 is substantially higher than the ₹50,000 crore it got from the RBI in 2017-18, and this is the second successive year the central bank is making an interim transfer: last year it transferred ₹10,000 crore. Though there is nothing wrong in a shareholder demanding an interim dividend payout, the fact is that the Centre is advancing a receipt from the next fiscal to bail itself out in the current one. Should the RBI decide not to repeat this practice, the government’s revenues will suffer because as much as ₹82,911 crore has been budgeted on this count for the next fiscal. Again, the central bank is not like a corporate enterprise, nor can the government compare itself with a company shareholder. The RBI’s income and surplus growth cannot be measured in commercial terms since a large part of it comes from statutory functions it has to perform as a regulator. \n",

      " The large payout this fiscal is bound to raise eyebrows, especially because of the recent history of conflict between the RBI and the Centre over the sharing of the former’s accumulated reserves as dividend with the Centre. Pressure on this count was said to be a major reason for the resignation of Urjit Patel as RBI Governor. Though the practice of an interim payout started under Mr. Patel, there are inevitable questions over whether there was pressure from the Centre now for the transfer of a higher sum than last year. This is because the Centre had in the Interim Budget bumped up receipts under this head from the central bank, nationalised banks and other financial institutions to ₹74,140 crore from the original estimate of ₹54,817 crore made in the 2018-19 Budget. Clearly, the Finance Ministry knew what it wanted. There will, hopefully, be a system and a structure in place once the committee under former RBI Governor Bimal Jalan, that is now reviewing the economic capital framework for the RBI, submits its report. It was constituted to de-personalise and institutionalise a system for the sharing of the RBI’s surpluses with the government, and is expected to come out with its recommendations by the end of the next month. \n",

      " Two hundred years ago, Napoleon Bonaparte said, “Men are powerless to fix the future; institutions alone determine the destinies of nations.”In the last two years, one of India’s premier institutions, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has seen its credibility take a huge hit. RBI gave up what independence it had when it acquiesced to an ill-conceived demonetisation.Subsequently, under instructions from the government, it stopped revealing the amount of old bank notes being deposited back into the banking system.It finally had to admit under parliamentary questioning that most of the invalidated currency had come back —and the Rs 3.5 trillion windfall the government expected vanished.RBI also bungled the execution of the badly planned demonetisation and, thereby, lost its reputation for competence. Notes were not printed on time; they did not fit the ATMs (automated teller machines) when they were printed, and had to be transported to remote areas under emergency-like conditions. Meanwhile, people and business, especially the micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) and agriculture sectors, suffered hugely. The economic cost was at least 1.5 per cent of GDP, but probably more.But just as RBI was beginning to get back to some semblance of normal functioning — and dealing with global volatility and domestic banking problems — it’s now hit again with a demonetisation redux.Rs 3.5 trillion is a magic number. It is the amount the Narendra Modi government failed to get as a bounty from the ill-fated demonetisation. Coincidently, it is approximately what it wants from RBI’s reserves to finance pre-election handouts, and yet, stick to its fiscal targets.It is threatening to invoke the neverbefore-used Article 7 of the RBI Act under which it can direct the central bank in public interest. It is the fundamental reason why the typically non-communicative RBI finally reacted through the emotive public speech by its deputy governor Viral Acharya, on October 26 — presumably with the approval of governor Urjit Patel There are other differences between RBI and the government: overly strict restrictions against state banks under the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework, insufficient liquidity to the non-bank finance companies (NBFCs), a proposed payments regulator and too tight monetary policy.GoI wants some forbearance for state banks to provide more liquidity to the NBFC sector. It also wants power sector non-performing loans (NPLs) to be treated more leniently. Another bone of contention is the government’s proposal to have a separate payments regulator, taking that function away from RBI — generally not considered a great idea. In the past, GoI and RBI have had differences on the conduct of monetary policy.RBI, to the government’s pleasant surprise, did not raise rates at its last meeting in October.

      " RBI is now being pressured to buy unsubscribed government bonds worth Rs 400 billion to lower the government securities (G-Sec) yield.GoI feels RBI was asleep on its watch and allowed excessive lending from the banking system during 2008-14. RBI has responded that it cannot be held responsible for the current banking mess because it does not have the same regulatory powers over state banks that it does over private banks. But its record on supervision is not exemplary.RBI was a principal regulator for Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS), a semi-private financial institution that had to be taken over recently by the government to avoid India’s ‘Lehman moment’.There is plenty of blame on both sides. But none of these differences would have led to a public breakdown. They form the back and forth between any central bank and government. The main reason for RBI’s intense reaction is the grab for its reserves, which hurts its bottom line directly.In June 2018, RBI had Rs 9.63 trillion of reserves, about 28 per cent of total assets. But two-thirds of these are in a revaluation account that can go up and down. An earlier committee recommended it hold 12 per cent of total assets in reserves. This is the logic that is being made for RBI to transfer around Rs 3.6 trillion to the finance ministry.The idea of using RBI’s ‘excess’ reserves was raised earlier to pay for the recapitalisation of the state banks. But then, RBI objected and GoI opted for a clever piece of financial engineering. It issued recap bonds worth Rs 1.35 trillion (in a total scheme of Rs 2.11trillion), which were bought by the same state banks that it recapitalised — increasing the public debt.Whether RBI is finally forced to transfer the ‘excess’ reserves or not, the public battle has surely damaged the perception of competence of India’s economic team both at North Block and in Mint Street. They should realise that they are tied to each other in a threelegged race in which coordination, not conflict, is the way to win — especially at a time of massive global volatility.And the Modi government may do well to heed Napoleon’s 200-year-old advice on the need for strong institutions, in India’s economic aspiration to become the world’s third-largest economy.(The writer is visiting scholar, Institute of International Economic Policy, George Washington University, US) \n",

      " In a full length feature on the Reserve Bank in 2012, The Economist had said that the RBI is a role model for the kind of full service central bank that is back in fashion worldwide. “There is something to that,” Subbarao said. “My philosophy has been that the nature of relationship or autonomy between Government and RBI depends on the situation. Broadly speaking, we need to emphasise autonomy in operations, harmony in policies and coordination for structural changes. In times of serious crisis, it is first line of defence, but can draw strength only from government. Autonomy depends on the subject and context also,” Reddy said. Subbarao’s advice: It is also important that the mandate of the Reserve Bank is written into the statute, so that it is protected from the political dynamics of changing governments. \n",

      " The Reserve Bank of India, in line with expectations, went for a rate hike and changed the repo rate to 6.5 per cent in its third bimonthly policy meet of 2018-19.Here is the full text of the RBI's monetary policy statement.On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: • increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points to 6.5 per cent.Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 6.25 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.75 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with the neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.2. Since the last meeting of the MPC in June 2018, global economic activity has continued to maintain steam; however, global growth has become uneven and risks to the outlook have increased with rising trade tensions. Among advanced economies (AEs), the US economy rebounded strongly in Q2, after modest growth in Q1, on the back of rising personal consumption expenditures and exports. In the Euro Area, weak growth in Q1 continued in Q2 due to subdued consumer demand, weighed down by political uncertainty and a strong currency. In Japan, recent data on retail sales, consumer confidence and business sentiment point to moderation in growth.3. Economic activity in major emerging market economies (EMEs) has slowed somewhat on volatile and elevated4. Global trade lost some traction due to intensification of trade wars and uncertainty stemming from Brexit negotiations. Crude oil prices, which remained volatile and elevated in May-June on a delicate demand-supply balance, eased modestly in the second half of July on higher supply from Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) and non-OPEC producers. Base metal prices have fallen on the general risk-off sentiment triggered by fears of an intensification of trade wars. Gold prices have softened on a stronger dollar. Inflation remained firm in the US, reflecting higher oil prices and stronger aggregate demand. Inflation has edged up also in some other major advanced and emerging economies, driven, in part, by rising energy prices and pass-through effects from currency depreciations.5. Financial markets have continued to be driven mainly by monetary policy stances in major AEs and geopolitical tensions. Equity markets in AEs have declined on trade tensions and uncertainty relating to Brexit negotiations. Investors’ appetite for EME assets has waned on increases in interest rates by the US Fed. The 10-year sovereign yield in the US has moderated somewhat from its peak on May 17 on safe-haven demand, spurred by escalating trade conflicts. Yields have softened in other key AEs as well. In most EMEs, however, movements in yields have varied reflecting domestic macroeconomic fundamentals and tightening global liquidity. Capital flows to EMEs declined in anticipation of monetary policy tightening in AEs. In currency markets, the US dollar appreciated, supported by strong economic data. The euro strengthened in June on receding political uncertainty and taper talk by the central bank. However, the currency has traded soft thereafter on mixed economic data and the rising US dollar. EME currencies, in general, have depreciated against the US dollar over the last month.6. On the domestic front, south-west monsoon has been recovering after a brief spell of deficiency in the second half of June. The cumulative rainfall up to July 31, 2018 was 6 per cent below the long-period average. In terms of spatial distribution, 28 of the 36 sub-divisions received normal or excess rainfall, whereas 8 sub-divisions received deficient rainfall as against three sub-divisions last year. The total sown area of kharif crops as on July 27 was 7.5 per cent lower than that a year ago. The live storage in major reservoirs as on July 26 was at 41 per cent of the full reservoir level compared with 36 per cent a year ago, which portends well for the rabi sowing season.7. Industrial growth, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), strengthened in April-May 2018 on a y-o-y basis. This was driven mainly by a significant turnaround in the production of capital goods and consumer durables. Growth in the infrastructure/construction sector accelerated sharply, reflecting the government’s thrust on national highways and rural housing, while the growth of consumer non-durables decelerated significantly. The output of eight core industries accelerated in June due to higher production in petroleum refinery products, steel, coal and cement. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector remains robust. The assessment based on the Reserve Bank’s business expectations index (BEI) for Q1:2018-19 remained optimistic notwithstanding some softening in production, order books and exports. The July manufacturing PMI remained in expansion zone, although it eased from its level a month ago with slower growth in output, new orders and employment. 8. Several high-frequency indicators of services activity increased at a faster pace in May-June. Tractor and two-wheeler sales growth accelerated significantly, suggesting strong rural demand. Passenger vehicle sales growth, an indicator of urban demand, also strengthened. Commercial vehicle sales growth remained robust despite some deceleration. Domestic air passenger traffic – another indicator of urban demand – maintained double-digit growth. Construction activity indicators also improved with cement production sustaining double digit growth for the eighth consecutive month in June. Steel consumption also accelerated in May. The services PMI expanded to a twelve-month high in June, after a marginal contraction in May, supported by expansion in new business and employment.9. Retail inflation, measured by the year-on-year change in the CPI, rose from 4.9 per cent in May to 5 per cent in June, driven by an uptick in inflation in fuel and in items other than food and fuel even as food inflation remained muted due to lower than usual seasonal uptick in prices of fruits and vegetables in summer months. Adjusting for the estimated impact of the 7th central pay commission’s house rent allowances (HRA), headline inflation increased from 4.5 per cent in May to 4.6 per cent in June. Low inflation continued in cereals, meat, milk, oil, spices and non-alcoholic beverages, and pulses and sugar prices remained in deflation.10. Fuel and light group inflation rose sharply, pulled up by liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene. Inflation in firewood and chips ticked up, while electricity inflation remained low. The pass-through of global crude oil prices impacted inflation in domestic petroleum products as well as transport services. Inflation also picked up modestly in respect of education and health.11. The June round of the Reserve Bank’s survey of households reported a further uptick of 20 basis points in inflation expectations for both three-month and one-year ahead horizons as compared with the last round. Manufacturing firms polled in the Reserve Bank’s industrial outlook survey (IOS) reported higher input costs and selling prices in Q1:2018-19. The manufacturing PMI showed that input prices eased slightly in July, although they remained high. Input costs for companies polled in Services PMI in June also stayed elevated. Farm and non-farm input costs rose significantly. Notwithstanding some pick-up in February and March 2018, rural wage growth remained moderate, while wage growth in the organised sector remained firm.12. Systemic liquidity remained generally in surplus mode during June-July 2018. In June, the Reserve Bank absorbed surplus liquidity of around ?140 billion on a daily net average basis under the LAF even as the system migrated from net surplus to a net deficit mode in the second half of the month due to advance tax outflows. Interest rates in the overnight call money market firmed up in June reflecting the increase in the repo rate on June 6, 2018. The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded, on an average, 12 basis points below the repo rate – the same as in May. Systemic liquidity moved back into surplus mode in early July with increased government spending but turned into deficit from July 10 onwards; on a daily net average basis, the Reserve Bank injected liquidity under the LAF of ?107 billion in July. The WACR in July, on an average, traded 9 basis points below the policy rate \n",

      " Based on an assessment of prevailing liquidity conditions and of durable liquidity needs going forward, the Reserve Bank conducted two open market operation (OMO) purchase auctions of ?100 billion each on June 21 and July 19, 2018.13. Export growth picked up in May and June 2018 on a y-o-y basis, aided by engineering goods, petroleum products, drugs and pharmaceuticals, and chemicals. Import growth also accelerated largely due to an increase in crude oil prices. Among non-oil imports, gold imports declined due to lower volume, while imports of machinery, coal, electronic goods, chemicals, and iron and steel increased sharply. Double-digit import growth in May and June pushed up the trade deficit. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment (FDI) flows improved significantly in the first two months of 2018-19. With the tightening of liquidity conditions in AEs, growing geopolitical concerns and with the escalation of protectionist sentiment, net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) outflows from the domestic capital market have continued, albeit at an increasingly slower rate. India’s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 404.2 billion on July 27, 2018.14. In the second bi-monthly resolution of 2018-19, CPI inflation for 2018-19 was projected at 4.8-4.9 per cent in H1 and 4.7 per cent in H2, including the HRA impact for central government employees, with risks tilted to the upside. Excluding the impact of HRA revisions, CPI inflation was projected at 4.6 per cent in H1 and 4.7 per cent in H2. Actual inflation outcomes have been slightly below the projected trajectory as the seasonal summer surge in vegetable prices has remained somewhat muted in comparison with its past behaviour and fruits prices have declined.15. The inflation outlook is likely to be shaped by several factors. First, the central government has decided to fix the minimum support prices (MSPs) of at least 150 per cent of the cost of production for all kharif crops for the sowing season of 2018-19. This increase in MSPs for kharif crops, which is much larger than the average increase seen in the past few years, will have a direct impact on food inflation and second round effects on headline inflation. A part of the increase in MSPs based on historical trends was already included in the June baseline projections. As such, only the incremental increase in MSPs over the average increase in the past will impact inflation projections. However, there is a considerable uncertainty and the exact impact would depend on the nature and scale of the government’s procurement operations. Second, the overall performance of the monsoon so far augurs well for food inflation in the medium-term. Third, crude oil prices have moderated slightly, but remain at elevated levels. Fourth, the central government has reduced Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates on several goods and services. This will have some direct moderating impact on inflation, provided there is a pass-through of reduced GST rates to retail consumers. Fifth, inflation in items excluding food and fuel has been broad-based and has risen significantly in recent months, reflecting greater pass-through of rising input costs and improving demand conditions. Finally, financial markets continue to be volatile. Based on an assessment of the above-mentioned factors, inflation is projected at 4.6 per cent in Q2, 4.8 per cent in H2 of 2018-19 and 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 1). Excluding the HRA impact, CPI inflation is projected at 4.4 per cent in Q2, 4.7-4.8 per cent in H2 and 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20.16. Turning to the growth outlook, various indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to be strong. The progress of the monsoon so far and a sharper than the usual increase in MSPs of kharif crops are expected to boost rural demand by raising farmers’ income. Robust corporate earnings, especially of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies, also reflect buoyant rural demand. Investment activity remains firm even as there has been some tightening of financing conditions in the recent period. Increased FDI flows in recent months and continued buoyant domestic capital market conditions bode well for investment activity. The Reserve Bank’s IOS indicates that activity in the manufacturing sector is expected to remain robust in Q2, though there may be some moderation in pace. Rising trade tensions may, however, have an adverse impact on India’s exports. Based on an overall assessment, GDP growth projection for 2018-19 is retained, as in the June statement, at 7.4 per cent, ranging 7.5-7.6 per cent in H1 and 7.3-7.4 per cent in H2, with risks evenly balanced; GDP growth for Q1:2019-20 is projected at 7.5 per cent (Chart 2).17. Even as inflation projections for Q2 have been revised marginally downwards vis-àvis the June statement, projections for Q3 onwards remain broadly unchanged. Several risks persist. First, crude oil prices continue to be volatile and vulnerable to both upside and downside risks. In particular, while geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions remain an upside risk to oil prices, the fall in global demand due to further intensification of protectionist trade policies could pull down oil prices. Second, volatility in global financial markets continues to impart uncertainty to the inflation outlook. Third, households’ inflation expectations, as measured by the Reserve Bank’s survey, have risen significantly in the last two rounds, which could influence actual inflation outcomes in the months to come. Fourth, manufacturing firms polled in the Reserve Bank’s industrial outlook survey have reported hardening of input price pressures in Q2 of 2018-19. However, if the recent softening of global commodity prices persists, it could mitigate some of the upward pressure on input costs. Fifth, though the monsoon has been normal temporally so far, its regional distribution needs to be carefully monitored in the context of key CPI components such as paddy. Sixth, in case there is fiscal slippage at the centre and/or state levels, it could have adverse implications for market volatility, crowd out private investment and impact the outlook for inflation. Seventh, uncertainty around the full impact of MSP on inflation will only resolve in the next several months once the price support schemes are implemented. Finally, the staggered impact of HRA revision by state governments may push headline inflation up. While the statistical impact of HRA revisions will be looked through, there is need to watch out for any second-round impact on inflation.18. Against the above backdrop, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis.19. The MPC notes that domestic economic activity has continued to sustain momentum and the output gap has virtually closed. However, uncertainty around domestic inflation needs to be carefully monitored in the coming months. In addition, recent global developments raise some concerns. Rising trade protectionism poses a grave risk to near-term and long-term global growth prospects by adversely impacting investment, disrupting global supply chains and hampering productivity. Geopolitical tensions and elevated oil prices continue to be the other sources of risk to global growth.20. Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Dr. Viral V. Acharya and Dr. Urjit R. Patel voted in favour of the decision; Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia voted against the decision. The minutes of the MPC’s meeting will be published by August 16, 2018. 21. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled from October 3 to 5, 2018 \n",

      " AK: NBFCs are in a crisis because of crony capitalism. That was clear in the case of IL&FS. There was diversion of funds and so on. So, there is a need for a proper regulation of the NBFCs. I also feel that the spread of banking has to increase (so that) proper loans can be given to the small and tiny sectors. This would reduce their dependence on shadow banking, and informal money markets. But, to do so, due diligence should not be given up otherwise NPAs would rise as is currently the case with our banking system. The government wants to give loans up to Rs.50 lakh automatically but that can create big problem. Whatever loans have to be given from the banking system must be through due diligence but without causing harassment or creating space for corruption. Procedures can be simplified and made transparent. \n",

      " The role of the RBI board is to be the wise counsel, to play a Rahul Dravid, not to make operational decisions and certainly not be loud like Navjot Sidhu,former governor, RBI tellsofEdited excerpts:Let us back off from the current controversy and think about what the relation between the Govt and Central Bank is. Dr Viral Acharya talked about T-20 and the Test match. A good analogy of the Central Bank is - it’s a seat belt for the Govt, which is a driver. The driver may not put on the seatbelt but the seatbelt is useful in times of a crash.Now think about the Central Bank’s thinking about the crash, “I want to protect financial stability because I do not want that to be a terrible event.” And the driver is thinking about the process of normal driving and says I want to be relatively free of constraint. But when they talk to each other they realize that there is some value in putting on that seat belt, because it prevents unfortunate eventuality.The historic relationship between the Govt and the RBI has been based on the fact that Govt naturally and correctly thinks about pushing growth and for that it wants maximum freedom given to all the entities responsible for growth. But the RBI focuses on financial stability and says here is the amount of growth that I can allow without impeaching on financial stability. And they work with each other on that basis. The Govt always pushes letters on the table saying relax this etc. They know we will look at the letter carefully and take a view. But that view would be how we maximise growth while protecting financial stability. Ultimately, the responsibility is with the RBI for financial stability and if we failed on it we would be held to task. So given that responsibility we have the authority to say no. Let me remind you of that quote in Dr. Subbarao's book where talked about the relationship between Dr. Reddy and Mr. Chidambaram based on a phone call. Where Dr. Reddy's side he was hearing and Dr. Reddy said No, No, No, No, and Yes eventually. When Dr. Subbarao asked what were you saying No to and Dr. Reddy said he asked me to relax this, relax that and I kept saying No. Ultimately he asked can you hear me and I said Yes and that's how the call ended. That anecdote is really about the relationship between the relationship of Reserve Bank and the government. Govt appoints the governor, appoints the deputies but ultimately goes by the views knowing these are professionals. They are not doing it for political reasons, or for their own self-inetrest, they are doing it because they have a taken a view on the ultimate stability of the country.No, I think it is possible to disagree but still be respectful to each other's territory. Certainly in my relationships there were many disagreements but I hope there was an understanding that this was not because of bloody-mindedness but because there was a worry and they knew when the RBI said yes, it meant we were taking responsibility for the financial stability consequences. We always tried to maximise the potential for growth while keeping that financial stability in concern. Of course the RBI essentially in some ways the agency of the government and of course it has to respect the overall concerns and objectives of the government. But the government has entrusted it with the responsibility for financial stability and therefore it has to, as a good responsible entity carry out that responsibility. And sometimes, as I said, the seatbelt constraints but that seatbelt constraints because you put it on and you put it on knowing that it will prevent you from an accident.Section 7 hasn't been invoked so that's the good news and I do believe that when the relation gets so precarious that it has to be invoked then we have to be very worried. That said, I think the dialogue between the RBI and Govt is always an ongoing one. There are always sort of points of you being expressed and sometimes there are sort of disagreements. But ultimately it works based on respect. You have to know why the other guy is doing what he is doing and ultimately at the end of the day you have to part maybe not as friends but having respect for each other's territory. It's when you encroach each other's territory that it becomes problematic and I would hope that respect gets re-established.I would rather hope that people take the right lesson from what has happened so far and back off from the cliff edge. I think both sides have to listen to each other, but I think there also has to be a respect of each one’s turf. What to my mind is most worrisome is the change in the role played by RBI’s board in all this. The RBI board is not an operational board. It’s not led by professional supervisors and central bankers. These are all people from different walks in life whose main role is to play the wise people, to advise, to counsel. To play a Rahul Dravid, to coach in some sense. But not to make operational decisions. Certainly not be loud like Siddhu. What I am very worried about is the change in tenor. They are supposed to be the wise people who bridge differences rather than force greater ones. We’ve had excellent people on those boards. There are still very good people on the board and I hope that they would come together to bridge these differences and reduce some of the noise that is coming. I don’t think India should have a breakdown in the dialogue between the central bank and the govt. I don’t think it needs to happen I don’t think if wiser minds prevail, it will happen.I don’t want to comment on specific personalities but really the govt appoints people on board primarily to ensure that the governance of the institution is in the direction that the country desires. To check that they are not paying themselves inordinate salaries but also to give them a guidance about what people from different walks in life think. I think that is the role of the board rather than to intervene in operational decisions and to substitute their judgment for the judgment of the professionals who actually manage the RBI. I think we need to do this separation because clearly in the recent past, we are transcending what should be the appropriate role of the board and I hope that there is a dialogue between all the parties concerned to reset what should be happening.I think there are 2 separate issues which are being confounded. One is the issue of fraud, not necessarily the same wilful defaulter. Wilful defaulter is somebody who doesn’t want to pay but who hasn’t run away with the money. On the issue of frauds the full arm of the force of the law should be employed to bring these frauds to book and to essentially show that the Indian law enforcement structure is capable of doing that. That’s certainly is work in progress. Separately there is the issue of number of business people who the banks believe are not paying them when they have the ability to pay and eventually through a quasi-judicial process declare wilful defaulters. I am not well versed enough legally to understand why those names cannot be made public after they have been through a judicial process but this is something that belongs to the legal realm rather than something I have expertise inSo, Look, I don't want to get into the specifics of the case because there is more information that I have on the specific frailties of the NBFCs. But generally in a situation where there is financial stress, the central bank has to figure out whether it is a liquidity problem and if infusing liquidity into the market will resolve some of those issues or is it a solvency problem, that is some of these entities have taken on really bad assets. If it is primarily solvency, you can address that by infusing liquidity in the market through more OMO's. If the problem is you need liquidity directed to certain places perhaps lend to certain entities who can make those loans and I think the recent move to allow banks to guarantee bonds by these entities is a good one \n",

      " I think any kind of intervention should come after these entities facing difficulties have taken their own steps to bolster their balance sheets. If your view is your commercial paper is coming from six months from now therefore you are worried about rollover, shouldn't you be raising equity now? Even if prices are depressed, in order to back your balance sheet, that would be a good signal than running to the govt and central bank to bail yourself out. If you are willing to take all the steps, it is only when all the markets are frozen, that you go at which point the govt has to decide if it is liquidity or solvency. If it is solvency it may require wiping out the equity of the entity and taking them over as for example I think IL&FS has been doing.Well we tried three times when I was the governor to have a comprehensive discussion on this dividend because this always becomes a source of controversy especially as we get close to the budget time and I wanted to make it a much cleaner & a mechanical process and I see that we haven’t really solved the issue. Let me explain because this is an issue that people need to know about. The reality is the RBI is a fully owned subsidiary of the govt which means that whatever value of equity there is in the RBI is an asset of the govt there is no 2 questions about that it belongs to the govt. Now that said is there reason to leave some equity on RBI balance sheet and not take it out as an enormous dividend and the reason for that is we are a country which has a BAA rating and if the country went out to borrow in international capital markets for some emergency it would have to pay at BAA rating rates. Having the RBI as a separately capitalized entity which has a AAA rating gives you a vehicle which can actually make promises in international markets that are credible.One place where we had to make promise is was in the swap agreement in 2013 because we were essentially guaranteeing would pay up on that swap even though all the entities on the other side had to take was our word but we were good for it because we had plenty of capital to back the payments we would have to make and so in for a rainy day it helps to have one entity in the country which is well capitalized and which can hold its own in international capital markets. Now the first aspect of dividend is will it essentially maintain that high quality rating that you want for the RBI and today I think with the recent depreciation in the rupee the value of the RBI’s equity has gone up because remember the RBI has 400bn or so in dollar assets.When the rupee depreciates because its liabilities are in rupees essentially its equity goes up. So now it probably has reasonable amount of equities so then the second question comes, okay you have reasonable amount of equity you can pay…how much can you pay? And this is where the accountants keep telling us you cannot pay more than the profits. So we can pay the profits and we can pay as much as we make and that is what we were doing during 3 years I was governor. We paid all the profits not holding 1 naya paisa back. Then the 3rd question comes… can you pay more than this and ofcourse there is accounting issue, the credit worthiness issue but beyond that there is a third issue which is that the RBI is not like an ordinary PSU, it actually prints the money which means that if I pay an extraordinary dividend lets say 3 lakh crores it essentially means 3 lakh crore more of money is there in the capital markets and that is going to be inflationary. So as I pay 3 lakh cr to the govt I then have to sell govt bonds in the market to suck out equivalent 3 lakh crore in order that we do not have an inflationary situation.So unless I really make profits which I can give to the govt because the money made of people in the market, if I pay anything more it becomes inflationary and I have to take it back by selling bonds again and again I have emphasized that really there is no free lunch here. There is no 3 lakh crore that the RBI can give the govt and say do what you want with it because it gives from one hand and it sells an equivalent amount of govt bonds in the market. Net net the public sector borrowing requirement does not change. The govt has the same problem financing its deficit as it had before because this 3 lakh crore cannot be usedLet me not go into direct details of PCA norms. Look what I find problematic sometimes is arguments that why don’t you go down to Basel levels. Well it is true that on some issues Basel maybe a little more flexible than the Indian situation but there are many other places where the Indian situation is much more flexible than Basel. Ultimately if we go strictly by Basel we will get accused of being in the of thrall of foreign hands and so on you are listening only to foreigners. On the other hand if we do something based on the Indian situation you are accused of not following Basel especially when its tighter than Basel. I don’t think this is a debate is really is a serious one.What you have to ask is what are the Indian conditions that require a certain level of precautions and RBI is a professional that should be trusted if it could explain why that level is needed. By all means ask for an explanation but let them use their professional judgement. On the MSME, go to any country in the world find an MSME which says it isn’t starved for funds.The reality is MSME’s are hard to lend to which is why there is always clamoring for more funds. The right way to get more funds for them is to improve the formalization, the kind of business environment they operate in which is why I think if the improvement in doing business ratings that we have seen in the recent past is real then in fact that is a good way to help the MSMEs but simply opening the tap wider for them or saying less provisioning runs the risk of making loans that then come back to roost as higher NPAs.My worry is that we have to do a proper assessment of the loans we have already mad, what has been the experience with the Mudra scheme, what has been the experience with the other MSME lending and my worry is that NPAs there are far bigger than we think especially because there is a constant clamour to say don’t declare it an NPA that suggests that we should be more worried rather than less worried and I think that the government is right in going on a path to expanding the possibilities of MSMEs. The right way to do it is to improve the business environment & to improve the credit process but not to relax the credit standards and that I think is an important distinction which we should keep in mindLook I don’t know. I will go by the noises that are made and it certainly seems to be that there is an intent to bring these people to book but I do think from the longer term perspective if frauds go by unpunished it simply encourages more fraud. If there is a sense that there is no place on earth where you can hide because the long arm of the Indian govt will come after you, I think it will send a very sound message because you won’t be able to enjoy the ill gotten wealth anyway. This message needs to be sent if we are to protect out banking system. Because ultimaltely, you can’t prevent fraud but you can create the incentives such that it doesn’t pay.You can always enter an endless debate about this process. Let me just say that there is room for improvement on all sides on the governance of the banks. Both on the private sector as well as in the public sector both in the role that government plays as well as the role the RBI plays. I think we have to recognize that the level of NPAs in both the public sector as well as the private sector is not by any means a level to be proud of. So we have to all examine what went wrong and do what is necessary to put the banking system on a healthy turf because going forward the amount of lending we need to get to that 9-10% growth that we absolutely must have in order to employ all the people that are coming into the labor force. We need a healthy sector. Every side has to contribute and there’s really not much value in pointing fingers. There’s plenty of work for everyone to do.Look I think we need to have a longer term strategy in mind. I think historically short term moves to address short term problems have proven problematic. In the longer run if we want to make in India I think we have to have a far more open economy. We need to be part of global supply chains, we need to attract the business that is leaving China and going to Vietnam rather than coming to India That typically means much lower tariffs, of course we have lower tariffs over time but lower tariffs and a presumption that the tariffs will stay low and predictable because just haphazardly raising it here and raising it there will essentially make it hard to produce in this country.So I think given how much of the Products that we export are imported, our aim should be to lower tariffs generally and to have a more open the economy. Of course we can measure in that and think carefully about it but this knee jerk raising of tariffs here and raising of tariffs there to deal with what is fundamentally a savings investment problem I think is problematic.That said you know the current account deficit is heading towards 3% I think that is certainly one worry especially if the prices of oil that is so volatile pushes it higher. The other big worry is you know after 5 years of fiscal consolidation the general government deficit which is state + centre is still stuck at around &. In fact over the course of this government it has been going up not because the centre hasn’t done what it is supposed to do but because the states have been increasing their deficit. I think the one time we had the big jump down was when Mr Chidambaram came and reduced the fiscal deficit by about a percentage point but since then we have been stuck at about 7 for the aggregate.That’s a problem because 7% fiscal deficit doesn’t look that good when you have current account deficit to boot as well as you have growth which is at around 7You are asking me to choose between the devil & the deep blue sea. Both are bad. I think we have had a number of committees which have talked about responsible sort of fiscal management including the N K Singh Committee, I think we should take from all that , there is sometimes tendency to believe that all that markets worry about is that the bottom line no on the fiscal from the centre and clearly its much more than that as we have seen with the pricing of the govt bonds, the yields have moved up, even though the centre is bringing down the fiscal deficit the way you bring it down also matters. Whether you bring it down by actually matching revenues to expenditure or whether you get one time dividends from PSU which then go out and borrow in the market & therefore by that token don’t actually reduce the overall borrowing requirement . Over time we have steadily tried to improve our fiscal management and should continue to do so because ultimately the markets are not fooled by numbers if they don’t believe the underlying sort of fundamental change.Well it is a big over hang right now & I do think that we should be worried about the dialogue coming from each country, in the US make America great , in China make china great , every country wants to make itself great ,but it comes at the expense of relationships with other countries & the trade conflict right now is one of the worries …the hope is that what we will see overtime is a better understanding of each other’s position. I think there are some agreements to be had right now, if in fact China can convince The United States that it will change its behaviour on the acquisition of intellectual property & the extent to which it coerces companies coming into China to part with it & on the flip side if The US assures China that it is not going to use tariffs as a general means of blocking Chinas part to growth . There is an agreement to be had but it requires significant negotiation, it requires a deep understanding of each other’s position and ultimately it requires an acceptance that China is going to be one of the big powers and has to have place on the global stage eventually on par with the United States.I think it’s a process of learning & you can’t expect china to do that immediately, but at the same time the worst way to get China to become a responsible global player is to essential tell them that we don’t like your rise and are going to stand in your way. What that means is that then China will back off from international engagement focus on building its power looking both inward and regionally & eventually that would not be good for the world because it certainly would be a start of a cold war if not eventually a hot war. There needs to be much more dialogue between the countries & a cosmetic agreement which is possible at the G- 20 meetings will satisfy no body and will serve no purpose because ultimately you have to recognize the deeper sort of challenges that both countries face today.We have had 10 years of very easy money & that has resulted in high levels of leverage both in pockets in United states but also across the world, enormous amounts of money have flowed into the Emerging markets & what that means is as the FED continues to raise interest rate & it will do so because the US economy is chugging along very nicely, the labour market is tight, the job numbers that came were very healthy but also wage growth is picking up. So the FED is worried about inflation its going to raise interest rates & entities that have borrowed a lot specially in dollars are going to face the consequences down the line as rates go up and roll over becomes more difficult so this I think is a concern. Today it is massed by the strong growth of the US economy but remember this is a stimulus which has come late cycle. It’s a fiscal stimulus which eventually will wear off into next year at which point you will have FED high rates as well as the high debt but not the stimulus for growth. My sense is that we should be preparing for a more volatile world going forwardSo I learnt way back in my tenure that the IMF never comment on currencies and I will stick to that because we really don’t know what the true level should be. I think by most estimates there has been an adjustment of Indian rupee towards a more comparative value. I think depending on where you look from the Indian Rupee is probably appropriately valued and still you could either argue little undervalued or little overvalued, but I think that at this point our focus should not be so much on the rupee but on doing all the things that will allow the rupee to find its appropriate value which means focus on macro stability and ensure that india presents a very healthy picture to the world when that volatility comes.I don’t know what he has in mind ultimately it’s the trading desk at the Reserve bank which trades both in the futures market as well as in the spot market. So in that sense I am not sure what he means by dual role, if he means that there is more being voiced about the rupee from Delhi. Well that varies from administration to administration. The historical sort of norm has been that really it’s the RBI which talks about the exchange rate & typically in my time we didn’t talk about it either because it was a sensitive issue there is no way you can speak about it in the right way just leave it alone, don’t talk about it, don’t try and predict its going to be this or its going to be that and if you are moving markets with what you are saying you probably shouldn’t be saying it.I think the US is not afraid of using its various economic powers in directions where it thinks it will have effect and certainly I think in this administration there is a belief that if Iran is brought to its knees it will effectively agree to all that the administration wants in a new Iran treaty. So I think, we have got a wavier as I understand I for 6 months but I have no doubt that once the oil market is well supplied and prices are reasonable the administration will try again to shrink the supply of Iran in oil. Now that said if the oil market is well supplied & prices are reasonable it may not be directly harmful for India of course there are other geo-political issues at stake but I think that if in fact it comes when the market is tight which is possible then I think we could see a ramp up in oil prices which could be. \n",

      " NEW DELHI | MUMBAI: Former economic affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das was named the 25th governor of the Reserve Bank of India to succeed Urjit Patel , who quit abruptly on Monday amid a bitter dispute over the regulator’s autonomy. The appointment means that the central bank will once again be headed by a former Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer. Patel, who had said he was resigning for personal reasons, and his predecessor Raghuram Rajan are economists.The government began the selection process soon after Patel’s resignation. It was expedited as the government didn’t want the post to remain vacant at a crucial juncture. The appointment will be for three years. He is likely to join at the earliest, sources told ET.Das, 63, a veteran Tamil Nadu cadre officer, will first have to work on normalising the relationship between the central bank and the government that had turned frosty in the past few months as the two differed on many issues.Das had been instrumental in establishing the monetary policy committee (MPC) and the switchover to an inflationtargeting regime, among other things.

      " This will also ensure a convergence of domestic and external policies.\"Welcoming the appointment, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said in a tweet, “Extremely seasoned & matured official with immense experience of finance. He is a brilliant team leader, a great consensus builder & highly communicative. Will focus on India’s economic growth while ensuring RBI’s autonomy.”Indian industry welcomed the appointment and hoped Das would address liquidity concerns. “We, in industry, are confident that the liquidity squeeze in the banking and non-banking financial sector, which is spilling over into the various segments of industry, would be taken up with all urgency by Das and there would be seamless flow of credit to industry and trade,” said Confederation of Indian Industry president Rakesh Bharti Mittal.Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (Ficci) president Rashesh Shah focused on the need to bring down real interest rates, improve liquidity and promote growth and employment.“Improving credit flow to the real economy, especially in sectors like MSME and housing is critical at this juncture,” he said.The government, which suffered a setback in state election results on Tuesday, will be keen to get cracking on programmes to accelerate economic activity and generate employment ahead of national elections next year. It has been seeking a special liquidity window for non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) that lend to small and medium enterprisesand create jobs in smaller towns. Finance minister Arun Jaitley told ET in an interview on Monday that while overall liquidity may have improved, some sectors still face issues.Das last served as secretary of the department of economic affairs, which means he has invaluable insight into what the government requires. In this role, he was the frontline government spokesman following demonetisation. Also, his interactions with the central bank during those years gives him firsthand knowledge of its functioning.The past few months have seen a battle between the government and the RBI over various issues such as the liquidity crunch that was putting the squeeze on credit, the strict prompt corrective action (PCA) for weak banks and the transfer of excess reserves on the RBI balance sheet.Differences worsened as a deputy governor made critical remarks and the government cited the never used Section 7 of the RBI Act to force a discussion on the points of dispute.However, Patel’s resignation was unexpected because the thorniest issues appeared to have been resolved last week ahead of the December 14 meeting of the RBI central board, where the row was playing out.The main agenda for that meeting was supposed to be the governance structure of the RBI. The government was said to be pushing for the central board to have more powers over the RBI despite the fact that many of the outside directors have other business interests, including some in financial services, potentially setting up conflicts of interest. \n",

      " Kolkata: The composition of the Board for Financial Supervision (BFS) could emerge as yet another point of conflict between the government and the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) after both sides stepped back from outright confrontation at a meeting of the regulator’s central board on November 19.The finance ministry is of the view that BFS needs to be broad-based and include representatives of the government, said people with knowledge of the matter. Ministry officials are said to be exploring options on how to ensure this before December 14, when RBI’s central board will meet again to discuss pending issues such as easing the prompt corrective action ( PCA ) framework for weak lenders and ensuring liquidity for non-banking finance companies (NBFCs).It had been decided at the November 19 meeting that PCA would be reviewed by BFS, one of the five committees under the central board.The governor forms BFS by co-opting four directors from the central board as members. RBI deputy governors are ex-officio members. A deputy governor, usually the one in charge of banking regulation and supervision, is nominated as vice chairman of BFS.The financial services or economic affairs secretary isn’t a member of BFS, three people close to the issue said.“However, if they happen to be in the city, they can attend central board committee meetings,” one of them said. Another of the three said that it was up to the RBI governor to invite government representatives.Relations between the two sides have been tense over the past few months. In October, deputy governor Viral Acharya sounded a warning about the damage that could be caused by undermining the autonomy of regulators \n",

      " The government had cited a hitherto unused section of the RBI Act that allows it to issue directions to the regulator in a series of communications that raised matters it wanted to discuss. Apart from PCA and liquidity, other key subjects are easing capital requirements for banks and the amount of surplus RBI needs.BFS was set up in November 1994 to provide guidance to RBI on financial supervision, which remains a cornerstone of banking regulation. It has assumed greater importance after the November 19 meeting.Typically, committee meetings take place in the second half of the day after central board meetings in the morning. But people close to RBI said BFS meetings may now have to be scheduled separately as the last two board meetings lasted more than nine hours each.The government wants RBI to ease PCA norms so that weaker banks can lend more freely. The central board has agreed to review the issue on December 14. The government also wants NBFCs to have access to adequate liquidity so that the current squeeze doesn’t develop into a credit freeze.The primary objective of BFS is to undertake consolidated supervision of the financial sector comprising commercial banks, financial institutions and NBFCs. It usually meets once a month to consider inspection reports and other issues placed before it by the supervisory departments.“This (finance ministry’s representation in BFS) will not be a good practice as the government owns banks,” said former finance secretary DK Mittal. \n",

      " India is the latest country to see age-old tensions between governments and central banks flare up as the era of easy money draws to a close. Modi government sent the central bank letters that cited a never-used power to overrule the Reserve Bank of India in a bid to push through measures that would unleash spending ahead of an election, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. That triggered a feisty speech from RBI deputy governor in defence of independence, which brought the spat into the open.As the rift looked set to deepen Wednesday, the government appeared to ease tensions, issuing a statement saying it “respects and nurtures” central bank autonomy. That helped the rupee claw back some of its losses while the benchmark stock index surged 1.6 percent on speculation the situation may improve now.The tension in India mirrors central bank fights playing out in countries as varied as the U.S. and Turkey, and is unlikely to go away soon. Modi faces reelection next year, and he wants banks to dole out loans quickly to keep the world’s fastest growing major economy firing. Wary of already high bad debts, emerging market strains that are pressuring the rupee and threatening to add to inflation, central bank Governor Urjit Patel has other priorities.“The Indian government is treading on dangerous ground with a number of moves that could put the independence of the RBI at risk,” said Shilan Shah, senior India economist at Capital Economics in Singapore. “A loss of credibility for the central bank could jeopardize its efforts to rein in inflation, which has been one of the big policy successes in India over the past few years.”The battle comes at a bad time for India. The economy is facing risks from elevated oil prices, a weak currency and a crisis in the shadow banking sector.While Modi’s coalition is facing the possibility of a reduced majority in the next election, there’s a slim chance disparate opposition parties could unite to oust him \n",

      " The central bank conflict lends itself to the view held by Modi’s critics that he has mismanaged the economy and is stomping over independent agencies.“For the health of India’s economy and institutions, the contingencies of politics must not be allowed to overrule the demands of fiscal and monetary prudence,” said Nikita Sud, Associate Professor at the University of Oxford.Earlier this month, Modi kicked up a political storm when his government removed the chief of the Central Bureau of Investigation. The Supreme Court is now scrutinising the decision, which opposition leaders said was done to block a probe into the controversial $8.7 billion Rafale deal.India’s central bank versus government tensions aren’t unique. Patel’s predecessor, Raghuram Rajan decided to head back to the University of Chicago after only one term. Rajan had faced criticism from a prominent Modi ally who accused the former IMF chief economist of keeping interest rates too high. Many bankers also complained about Rajan’s aggressive efforts to clean up bad debt at state-owned lenders.In 2013, Rajan’s predecessor Duvvuri Subbarao also fell out with then-finance minister Palaniappan Chidambaram, who complained high interest rates were an impediment to economic growth.Patel took helm at the central bank in 2016. The governor was initially seen as being more supportive of Modi’s policies compared with the outspoken Rajan. He was also instrumental in setting up a Monetary Policy Committee that tied policy making to an inflation target of 4 percent in the medium term.As part of that mandate, the RBI resorted to back-to-back rate hikes this year and tightened liquidity. The tighter conditions are likely to hurt growth, and with banks busy prioritizing bad loans resolution over new lending, the government faces a tough task of ensuring consumption -- the bedrock of the economy -- doesn’t fall off the cliff.The RBI’s top brass, though, is determined not to sweep the bad loans problems under the rug even if it comes at the cost of growth before an election year. Last week, Viral Acharya said the central bank wanted more powers to discipline errant government-owned banks, echoing Patel’s comments earlier this year.“The government should be mindful that as long as the disagreements stay as divergent opinions meant only for public posturing, a market backlash can be avoided,” said Rudra Sensarma, a professor of economics at the Indian Institute of Management in Kozhikode. The RBI also needs to convince the government “that its persistence with high interest rates and clampdown on errant banks are in the best interest of economic growth.” \n",

      " Given the allegations of crony capitalism that have dogged bank loans and restructuring processes in the past, it is understandable that the government should wish to distance itself from the process. So, rather than a bad bank which will take a decision on haircuts, the plan is to let commercial banks do this themselves, under the guidance of RBI. RBI, in turn, will set up various oversight committees to vet the decision-making process in the banks, while the government will change the Prevention of Corruption Act to ensure bankers taking decisions on haircuts are protected from scrutiny from courts or investigating agencies after the event. To add to the quality of decision-making, RBI Deputy Governor Viral Acharya has proposed each resolution plan be vetted and rated by at least two credit rating agencies that could also look at the company’s economic health—once a rating is given, needless to say, rating agencies will monitor the company regularly.

However, the competition law “hangs like a cloud over the regulated sectors as well” and the CCI’s jurisdiction will come into play where enterprises, while complying with the sector regulations, still do not compete with each other but, instead, collude with each other or abuse their dominance in ways that do not breach the sector rules (such as running a price cartel while keeping prices below regulatory caps), Dhall said.

This requires a number of actions,” Rajan said in his last speech as the Governor at St Stephen’s college, Delhi, on September 3, 2016. Rajan said there were always government entities that are seeking oversight over various aspects of the RBI’s activities. Multiple layers of scrutiny, especially by entities that do not have the technical understanding, will only hamper decision making. “Instead, the government-appointed RBI Board, which includes ex-officio government officials as well as government appointees, should continue to play its key oversight role. In this regard, all important RBI decisions including budgets, licenses, regulation, and supervision are now either approved by the Board or one of its sub-committees.

      " ARUN KUMAR (AK): One can’t predict what the FM would do. My suggestion would be to address the problems faced by the unorganized sector urgently. The current slowdown in the economy originated in the unorganized sector which has been declining since demonetisation. It was further hit by GST and then by the NBFC (crisis). Attempt to force digitization is further damaging it. This has led to the demand shortage which is now also impacting the organized sector. To revive the unorganized sector, a simpler GST (which I have been proposing) is required and credit availability to this sector improved. Businesses in this sector are short of working capital and cannot cope with GST even though they are exempt from registration under GST. The farming sector is a major component of this sector and needs support because the farmers’ incomes have been affected adversely. All this has impacted employment generation adversely. So, investment in employment generating sectors like, education, health and rural infrastructure, needs to be greatly stepped up. These need to be the government’s priorities. \n",

      " AK: Yes, fiscal consolidation has been done via creative accounting and in reality the deficit in the Centre’s budget is higher. There are two things. First, revenues are shown to be higher and later it turns out to be short. At that point, to maintain the deficit target, expenditures are cut. This results in shortfall in capital expenditures and essential sectors which can generate employment. Revenue has been short by about Rs.1.6 lakh crore and expenditures have been cut to this extent. This has an impact on demand. Second, disinvestment targets are fulfilled through sales of assets to the public sector and greater reliance is on the public sector via Internal Extra Budget Resources (IEBR). So in a sense, deficit has been shifted from the Centre on to the public sector. That is not the right way to do it. But most budgets resort to these stratagems. \n",

As an example, we consider how the RBI Central Board decides the annual expenses of the RBI; a relatively important decision about spending public money. The RBI annual report shows the RBI’s annual expenses in 2014-15 were Rs 13,356 crore. These are comparable to the annual expenditure of many states in India, and many times bigger than that of most central banks and regulators in India and abroad. Nearly a third, or more than Rs 4,000 crore, is spent on RBI staff salaries, superannuation, housing, maintenance, directors’ fee and board meeting expenses.

      " How could such an arrangement be possible in today’s India? The answer lies in the text of the RBI Act. In 1934, India’s British rulers did not see a role for defending public interest which could be in conflict with the interests of the RBI management — the sections of the Act relating to the functioning of the Board have not been amended even after Independence. Through regulations made by the Board (Regulation 15 of the RBI General Regulations), the board created a “Committee of the Central Board” to which it delegated all its powers. The management may invite a couple of directors to meetings of the Committee, based on whichever directors happen to be in Mumbai at the time. This Committee can meet often and take all decisions that are then approved by the Board — in effect, the RBI Central Board has abdicated its responsibilities to the people they were supposed to have oversight over, that is, the management. \n",

All decisions are taken by the board. In the case of the RBI, all the general powers of the Central Board have been delegated to the Committee of the Central Board — the Committee of the Central Board virtually can do everything that the Central Board can, under the RBI Act. This defeats the spirit of collective decision-making at the Central Board-level and circumvents the necessity of obtaining votes of the majority of members of the Central Board. The minutes of the Committee are placed before the Central Board; this serves little purpose as decisions are already taken and members did not participate in them.

For decades, the RBI board has functioned in a manner in which it did not deliberate on the most important decisions of the functioning of the RBI.

      " Mumbai: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is examining whether the deal between Hotel Leelaventure and Brookfield violated rules on related-party transactions and disclosures gave a true and fair picture.Minority shareholders of the hotel chain operator have alleged that no valuation report or fairness opinion was given to the audit committee and the board of the company, and that there was no discussion in the audit committee whether it was a related-party transaction.Conglomerate ITC, which also operates hotels and owns a 7.92% stake in Leela Leelaventure, has challenged the Brookfield deal before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), claiming “oppression” of minority shareholder interest and “mismanagement”. ITC and Life Insurance Corporation, which holds a 2.36% stake, have also approached Sebi separately, complaining about the deal. A person aware of the matter said both ITC an LIC have raised similar issues.One of the complaints to Sebi said no valuation report was tabled before the audit committee and the board of the company, whose approval to the transaction had been sought, despite lenders asking whether any valuation report had been obtained and about the process that had been followed before deciding to go ahead with Brookfield.It said JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company is a lender and a 26% equity shareholder, following a conversion of a part of loans to Hotel Leelaventure. As a financial creditor it moved the NCLT In January this year for the recovery of its loans outstanding. The minority shareholder alleged that the filing of the petition itself was akin to a related-party transaction — it was purporting to be a lender, but was also a 26% shareholder without whose consent no special resolution could be passed, said the person who has seen the complaint.PThe complaint said JM Financial ARC was playing two conflicting roles of shareholder as well as lender \n",

      " It also accused the promoters of having conflicting interests — of standing to receive monies in their own pockets as well as being a substantial shareholder in Hotel Leelaventure. These, it said, were detrimental to the interest of minority shareholders.\"Under securities laws, Sebi can look at the final ownership of hotels and the ultimate beneficiary of licence agreements and ask for a review from the audit committee and specific disclosure on RPTs (related-party transactions), keeping in view the complaints from shareholders,\" said Sumit Agrawal, partner at Regstreet Law Advisors and a former official at the regulator. “Sebi may also examine the valuation of slump sale and its impact on non-promoter holdings. Sebi has done that in the past.”The complaint said if the deal goes through, it would make Hotel Leelaventure a shell company with only liabilities residing in it, and benefiting the promoters who would receive at least Rs 300 crore. Minority shareholders will be left with holding worthless shares with no underlying business or assets left with the company, it said, according to the person.In March this year, Leelaventure announced that Canadian alternative asset management company Brookfield had agreed to purchase its assets, comprising key hotel properties in Delhi, Bengaluru, Udaipur and Chennai, for Rs 3,950 crore.As the per deal structure, the Mumbai hotel, which has huge liabilities, would remain with Hotel Leelaventure, the complaint said.Although the transaction involves a number of arrangements with the promoters and their affiliates, the postal ballot notice was drafted to mislead that it was not a related-party transaction, it said, adding: \"It is settled law that artful drafting cannot disguise the true nature of any transaction which must be ascertained by disregarding it.\"The promoters of Hotel Leelaventure and JM Financial ARC each being a related party are ineligible to vote as per Sebi's Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirements regulations, the complaint said.Sebi has asked both parties to the transaction to hold off on completion of the deal till it examines complaints filed by ITC and LIC. \n",

      " The Kotak petition, which I have reviewed, makes four compelling points. 1. RBI’s many changes on promoter shareholding, after it was granted a banking licence in February 2003, ought not be applied retrospectively to it. 2. RBI’s regulations are ultra vires of Sections 12, Sec 12(2) and Sec 12(B) of the Banking Regulation Act (BR Act). Kotak argues that the BR Act does not empower RBI to ask any bank to reduce shareholding; the Act only permits it to fix a ceiling on voting rights. Or, if a shareholder is found to be ‘not fit and proper’ [Sec 12-B (8)], to curtail such person’s voting rights to 5%. It further argues that RBI’s general powers under Sec 35-A to issue directions to banks and make delegated legislation, is also circumscribed by the need for these to be in public interest and to protect depositors’ interest. \n",

In 2005, RBI came up with new rules on ownership and governance of private banks and wanted the changes to apply retrospectively to Kotak.

      " The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in its 83-year history has not made to the front page news as often as it did in first nine months of 2018, facing questions on its credibility and capability. The year started off with bad news. While RBI was still grappling on the NPA front, LoUs (letters of undertaking) issued by PNB brought attention to a PSU bank with simultaneous questions on RBI’s role as a supervisor.While the media was still struggling to find cogent reasons for introducing LoUs as a banking instrument by RBI, controversies around Videocon, ICICI Bank and Chanda Kochhar shifted public glare from the PSU bank to the private bank. Suddenly, Kochhar, the former CEO of ICICI Bank, was in the limelight for alleged governance, transparency, disclosure and conflict-related issues. Soon, another private Bank, Axis Bank , was in the limelight due to tenure-related issues of its CEO, Shikha Sharma Another twist came with the dilution of promoter equity in Kotak Bank, in a perfectly legal manner (as claimed by the bank), but failing in the eyes of critics in the strict sense of the spirit of the law. Soon, RBI showed its teeth and rejected the dilution.RBI once again made to the front-page news with spotlight on IL&FS and Yes Bank. The sudden slide of a stable NBFC into a doubtful-of-survival category was too quick to digest. While the analyst community was still doing number crunching on IL&FS, the regulator passed a diktat curtailing the appointment terms of Yes Bank CEO Rana Kapoor . Soon after, it ordered freezing of Bandhan Bank CEO Chandra Shekhar Ghosh’s salary over failure to stick to shareholding rules.Negative news flow has impacted the share prices of these entities and investor have lost their wealth. Markets are averse to uncertainty and react irrationally. In all the cases cited above, uncertainty still prevails \n",

      " It appears that while the regulator is entitled to slap you, it may not tell you your mistakes. This lack of transparency is the root cause of disproportionate panic reaction and loss of investors’ wealth. Stakeholders are not aware what went wrong, if any, or what the extent of the wrong was, or whether the wrong is persisting or has been corrected, or who was in the wrong, or whether there was anything wrong at all.It is nobody’s case that RBI has not played its role in creating a robust financial ecosystem and has performed well. But a series of so-called alleged governance/ regulatory failures, without any final enquiry or adjudication, establishes one-sided supremacy of RBI. While there is absolutely no intent to dilute in any manner this supremacy in the best interest of the financial ecosystem, there is a pressing need for the regulator to see the mirror before someone else shows it to them.Is the IL&FS problem an overnight problem or did the regulator fail to see signals? What are the parameters on which RBI chose to show the door to CEOs of Yes Bank and Axis Bank, while keeping mum on ICICI Bank? Why was Bandhan allowed to go ahead with its IPO though Sebi requirements and RBI licence conditions clashed, ensuring that Bandhan will fail one of the regulators? Or, how can it demonstrate that risks can emanate from concentration of ownership in banking system alone and not in NBFCs, where promoters can own any level of equity although banks are more regulated compared to NBFCs?If high promoter equity was an issue, then Axis, ICICI and Yes Bank would not have had any issue of governance? How is the ownership of large equity through diversified non-operating holding company (NOHC) better compared to direct concentrated ownership? When can through minuscule economic risk, disproportionate voting rights be enjoyed by an individual in case of NOHC? How are leveraged political power with low economic risks better? Is higher economic risk by an individual promoter with capped voting rights not better from the governance perspective? Is high promoter stake hindrance to enforcing governance norms? Must governance measures be agnostic to ownership? And if diversified and low promoter equity was panacea of all ills of governance, then why RBI wants IL&FS to have strong shareholders and increase their equity? If higher equity of promoter is bad, then it is bad per se. Catholic Syrian bank is a classic case, where new promoters are allowed 51 per cent equity after earlier promoters followed RBI the diktat on reduction. Should the cycle repeat?RBI needs to put its house in order. Every failure brings an opportunity to rectify past mistakes. RBI needs to revisit its policies, procedure and even redefine objectives. It must constitute a committee of experts, stakeholders and in-house members with a mandate to address issues of governance, ownership, monitoring and reporting with clear cut penalty structure.As any regulatory action has farreaching impact, RBI should hold it horses except in urgent cases where damage is to be contained and controlled immediately.

      " Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) rejected the means by which Uday Kotak diluted his promoter stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank . The lender insisted it was compliant with regulations, setting the scene for a possible showdown with the regulator as a December deadline looms.Kotak had sought to lower his stake to 20%, as stipulated, by selling nonconvertible perpetual noncumulative preference shares (PNCPS) to a group of investors earlier this month. The limit has to be met by December.“RBI has today communicated to us that our PNCPS issuance does not meet their promoter holding dilution requirement,” Kotak Mahindra said in a statement to the exchanges on Tuesday evening. “We continue to believe that we have met the requirement and will engage with the RBI in this behalf.” A Kotak Mahindra spokesperson said the bank does not have anything to add to the stock market notice.“Kotak can say that they will engage with the regulator but approving this instrument later after rejecting it now would put the RBI’s credibility under the scanner,” said Manish Ostwal, senior analyst at Nirmal Bang Securities. “This rejection will have a negative impact on the stock when the market opens on Thursday because Kotak has little time now to comply with RBI regulations.”On August 2, bank founder Kotak sold 1 billion of the preference shares to domestic institutional investors and companies.At ₹5 apiece, the sale raised ₹500 crore, reducing Kotak’s stake to 19.7% from 30%.Analysts said the sale didn’t meet requirements as the preference shares are classified as AT1 or Tier 1 bonds according to the Basel III classification but are not part of common stock held by a bank, or equity capital, and hence won’t result in dilution of control, which is the intent of the central bank rule.The share ended at ₹1,291.60, up 0.31%, on Tuesday. Kotak’s statement came after market hours and the market is closed on Wednesday for the Independence Day holiday.The central bank requires promoters to reduce their stakes in banks in phases to ensure that ownership is widely distributed.Kotak last sold shares in May 2017 in the open market, lowering his stake in the private sector lender to below 30% in compliance with the RBI direction to do so.“Kotak will probably need to sell shares to multiple investors \n",

      " But this will create an overhang on the stock because a sale of 10% of the stock will create an overhang of $3 billion to $3.5 billion,” said Suresh Ganapathy, research analyst at Macquarie Securities. “Kotak has no choice now but to reduce stake. Going back to the regulator and trying to argue their point will not work because the regulator has taken a decision. Going to court is also not an option because you do not want to take on the regulator whose permission you need for business decisions.” Nirmal Bang’s Ostwal said approving Kotak’s sale would have created a precedent.“Promoters at IndusInd and Yes Bank could have also done the same,” Ostwal said. “RBI has taken the right decision. Kotak may be a credible institution but this was just against the spirit of regulations.” \n",

      "   The notice is largely a narration of the findings of SEBI’s TAC and the Deloitte report, much of which is already in the public domain. The main charges are that NSE’s tick-by-tick (TBT) system architecture was prone to easy manipulation and allowed brokers to connect first to get a price advantage; brokers who connect first through multiple IPs (internet protocol) could ‘crowd out’ others; and, certain brokers were given access to servers (including back-up servers) which had less of a load, giving them a big price advantage. Further, NSE had no standard operating procedures (SOP) for allocation of members to co-located (colo) servers, or documented policies and protocols with regard to various aspects of the TBT system, or retention of electronic records for key officers. There were oral instructions from ‘seniors’ about allocation and switching of colo servers. Requests by some brokers were entertained with alacrity while others were curtly denied. The upshot was that the favoured brokers reaped huge profits. Both, TAC and Delloitte, have documented the fact that NSE’s officials often misled them or did not cooperate in the investigation. \n",

      " The Buck Really Stops at SEBI and Not the NSE The panic triggered by the malfunction of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) on 10th July, when its prices were not updating and the Exchange was forced to remain shut for nearly three hours was, by no means, a ‘black swan’ event, as chairman Ashok Chawla described it. His statement not only trivialises the meaning of ‘black swan’ but also suggests that the NSE has been working flawlessly since its inception over 23 years ago. This is not true either of the NSE or any of the top exchanges in the world; even the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) faced an issue in 2014. Stock market glitches, that bring trading to a halt, have occurred at many top exchanges around the world. In the past five years, there have been issues at NASDAQ (in July 2017 and 2013); New York Stock Exchange (in 2016, 2015 and 2012); Intercontinental Stock Exchange (2015); Singapore Stock Exchange (2014); Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Tokyo Stock Exchange in 2012 and others.

After Chitra Ramakrishna controversially quit as NSE’s managing director on 2 December 2016 (her close associate, group operation officer Subramanian Anand also quit in October 2016), SEBI has been in no hurry to push the NSE to fill up the vacancy, or to ensure a proper management clean up and succession plan. Vikram Limaye was selected as NSE’s managing director in February 2017, but SEBI did not clear his appointment for several months. He is expected to take charge sometime next month after completing his assignment with the Board of Cricket Control of India (BCCI).

The overall trading turnover of Ways2wealth increased from 3.31% in January 2014 to over 9% in the second half of 2015, says the TAC. And, its share of algo-trading on the Exchange increased from 12.98% to over 25% in the same period. Elsewhere, it notes that Ways2Wealth’s turnover increased from 7.5% in April 2015 to 12% by August 2015, and dropped to around 10.6% after December 2015, “presumably as a result of other brokers being allowed to lay their colo line.” Hence, it says, “we can causally attribute” the increase in market share to laying the ‘dark fibre’. It is interesting that SEBI’s notice does not mention any of this and stops at noting that the NSE violated its own policies by allowing Sampark Infotainment to lay a dark fibre link to connect with the BSE.

In the minutes, only a few specific decisions, such as those related to specific companies or trade secrets that the law prevents regulators from revealing, are held back. The answer lies in the understanding that along with transparency comes autonomy. When participants know that discussions of the meeting will be made public, they, as well as those who may be sending letters or advice to the Board, behave more responsibly.

Moody’s had to fork out $864 million earlier this year to settle cases against it while S&P had to pay $1.4 billion after the DoJ launched a $5-billion suit against it. \n",

      " Only last week, India’s market regulator Sebi hauled up two prominent rating agencies, CARE Ratings and Crisil, for having failed to properly assess the debt paper issued by Amtek Auto and the risk associated with holding of Amtek bonds by JP Morgan under two schemes, respectively. In August 2015, it became clear that Amtek Auto was on the verge of defaulting on `800 crore of bond repayment. CARE, which had failed to warn the market of Amtek’s position sufficiently ahead of time, abruptly suspended its rating of the paper—after having rated it a high AA- for months. Crisil, for its part, lowered JP Morgan bond fund schemes’ ratings by eight notches in the space of just one month (September 2015) before announcing the withdrawal of ratings for the schemes. Prior to this, it had given them the highest rating for credit portfolio quality. The raters were caught napping, and Amtek paper became junk almost overnight, causing serious hurt to investors. Examples such as these can be multiplied manifold—indeed, chances are a very large proportion of the loans that are in trouble would have been taken from companies that have enjoyed a good rating in the past. Certainly, some rating agencies have valuable perspective to offer, and not all ratings are of the same quality, but with no skin in the game, raters have gone terribly wrong in the past—in cases where a company has suffered due to siphoning off of funds, the raters can’t even be blamed for this. While it is a good idea to get another opinion from a rating agency, basing a decision on this, or even justifying it is a bad idea. \n",

      " On public fora, whenever called upon to clarify their stands on in-house rating systems, mutual funds are not seen forthcoming with precise replies. The onslaught of sudden downgrades of rated papers has made mutual funds suffer earlier in Global Liquidity crisis of 2008 when they approached SEBI for non-saleable short term debt papers. That time SEBI stepped in for higher flexibility in debt paper valuations, on a temporary basis, of more than 300 basis points to help reflect the current value of debt holdings for mutual funds, said the ex-SEBI official. Further RBI had to help mutual funds providing a borrowing window of Rs 20,000 crores to help tide over panic redemptions, said the official. \n",

      " MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India RBI ) has pinpointed the conflict of interest in the functioning of credit rating agencies and is concerned over the role of the littleknown club of ‘rating advisers’, which are unregulated entities acting as brokers between companies and rating agencies.In a recent meeting, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das categorically questioned the dual practice of rating agencies to rate a bond as well as decide its valuation which is used by mutual funds (MFs) to calculate the net asset value, or NAV, of a MF scheme.Das said the two businesses pose a conflict as he asked senior agency officials present in the meeting about the share of ‘non-rating activities’ in earnings of rating companies. It is perceived that the motivation to downgrade a security would be lower for an agency which carries out both businesses.“The valuation of a bond is also function of liquidity in the market. If a price or value of a bond goes down, it could impact the rating. But the agency doing both may be reluctant to downgrade a rating or keep it under watch because it could make its rating transition and default statistics look bad,” a banker familiar with the discussions told ET.“While bond valuation is not a big business for rating agencies, it gives them a certain clout and builds their relationship with funds. More so, because rating MF schemes is another business for the rating agencies,” said the person.Das clearly spelt out that credit rating is a different kind of business in which revenue should not be the primary objective.“RBI officials made a note on the activities of rating advisers but did not express their views on the subject. These advisers, which have come up in the past five to six years, are small firms, often floated by former employees of rating agencies. They receive commission from issuing companies which are their clients as well as from rating companies \n",

      " Since they approach the agencies with the authorisation from client companies, agencies cannot shut them out. But there are suspicions that they misrepresent data and indulge in other sharp practices,” said an industry official.Such adviser-intermediaries are mostly hired by mid-sized corporates (and occasionally by large ones) which shop around for the best rating.Rating agencies have come under the glare after IL&FS bonds were downgraded from ‘triple-A’ (or, highest rating) to ‘D’ (or, default grade) in just 40 days. About 25,000 companies are rated in India, of which half are estimated to be below ‘investment grade’.The rotation of the rating agencies every five years – the kind of regulation that applies to auditors – is another suggestion that has cropped up in making the agencies more effective and independent. “The suggestion is that Sebi or RBI should play a role in the reappointment of an agency by a corporate. However, some of the agencies argue that this would disturb the long-term data on a bond issuer’s rating movements,” said a source.In recent years, agencies have become fiercely competitive. In the absence of any regulation on the fees they charge, there is a wide variation. Some of the agencies have even deviated from the indicative fee laid down by RBI for rating bank loans. The rating industry, it may be said, has grown with RBI stating that unrated loans would have to be assigned higher capital. \n",

      " Credit rating firms came under sharp criticism from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for failing to identify financial troubles in various companies, especially in the case of IL&FS.In a meeting with top credit ratings officials on Thursday, central bank governor Shaktikanta Das and the deputy governors expressed concerns over rating agencies’ inability to assess credit risk and take timely rating actions, said people who attended the meeting.“RBI said that ratings are supposed to be forward-looking, but they are always a laggard,” said one of the people quoted above. The central bank is said to have told credit ratings officials that the abrupt ratings downgrades in recent months have hurt investors and banks. RBI declined to comment on an email query by ET on the matter.Credit Rating agencies have been criticised for being late in identifying the stress in the IL&FS Group, which defaulted on its loans from banks, mutual funds and provident funds. Various debt mutual fund schemes saw erosion in their net asset values, or NAVs, because of the defaults. The crisis soon spread to other non-banking finance companies — mainly housing finance — which have been struggling to sort out their asset-liability mismatches.“RBI said one third of the total NPAs ( non-performing assets ) in the system stemmed from investment grade ratings,” said one of the persons quoted above.Total stressed assets are about Rs 12 lakh crore in the banking system \n",

      " Das was concerned over the “conflict of interest” in the country’s credit rating agencies, the person said.Globally, rating agencies limit themselves to ratings and research related to credit ratings. All other businesses like market research, training, risk solutions are carried out under separate entities with no common directors, employees and shareholding from the rating entity.In India, the same rating agency rates and provides valuation opinions to the same set of securities to investors like mutual funds and provides advisory services.“In many instances, the business origination employees are also common. In RBI’s view, this is conflict of interest and RBI is looking at suitable regulations to address this issue,” said one of the persons quoted above.The central bank governor disapproved of the practice of “rating shopping”— where companies migrate from one rating agency to another for better ratings. “RBI was also concerned about issues such as rating agency CEOs being part of rating committees and rating advisors who promise better ratings to an issuer due to their special relationship with rating agencies,” said the second person quoted above.RBI is examining the matter and along with Sebi, it will bring out regulations to address this, the person said.

For one, Sebi has to revive its August 2017 circular that made it mandatory for all listed companies to disclose all defaults in payment of interest and repayment of the principal within one working day. This was to come into effect last year, but pressure from corporates as well as banks resulted in Sebi postponing it. Indeed, this rule needs to be made mandatory for unlisted firms as well. Much of the problem in the IL&FS case, for instance, lay in the unlisted subsidiaries/associates. This is where RBI comes in. In the past, as the CIC notice to the RBI Governor makes clear, the central bank wasn’t keen on making defaults data public.

      " Moving to models like getting Sebi to pay for all ratings instead of the firms themselves—or perhaps even letting investors like UTI pay for them—sounds good since it seems to take away the conflict of interest inherent in a company paying for its own rating. But the problem with a Sebi paying for a rating is that the emphasis will no longer be on which rating agency is better; all the rating agencies will qualify, and then whoever quotes a lower fee will win the rating contract. Getting a UTI or a Franklin Templeton to pay means the rating will remain with just a few players instead of being disseminated to everyone as happens today. \n",

      " It’s a step towards a deeper bond market ,” said Rajesh Gandhi, Partner, Deloitte The idea is being discussed at a point when the bond market is grappling with conflicting regulatory moves. On one hand, the Securities and Exchange Board of India recently halved the listing time for corporate bonds to six days and introduced the mechanism where funds are debited from investors’ accounts only after allotment of securities.On the other hand, few months ago, the Reserve Bank of India brought in fresh investment restrictions — which are aimed at curbing concentration of investments and possible round-tripping of money stashed abroad in the run-up to the elections. Besides, rising US bond yields, the new rules are believed to have contributed to the recent bond selloffs by foreign portfolio investors.“The new diversification and concentration norms prescribed by RBI for FPIs, have impacted the manner in which FPIs used to invest in Indian corporate debt securities. The stipulation whereby investment by any FPI (including related FPIs) cannot exceed 50% of any corporate bond issue, has put a full stop on the earlier popular structures where a single FPI could have been the sole investors in a debt issuance. Also, the new diversification norms requiring an FPI to not have an exposure of more than 20% of its corporate bond portfolio in a single corporate group, have derailed the structures where special purpose FPIs were established to invest only in a select debt issuances of one corporate group. The said risk diversification norms may not be completely unwarranted, however may need to undergo certain tweaks,” said Tejas Chitlangi, senior partner, IC Universal Legal.Also, FPIs cannot hold more than 10% of their corpus in bonds of less than one year maturity — forcing many foreign investors to consider offloading even long-dated bonds which would mature in a year or so. “On tap market is a step in the right direction, but liquidity could further suffer if these new restrictions which make little sense are not removed. We have raised the issue with the finance ministry,” said a banker. \n",

For instance, Gujarat may offer more docile workers and a state government which is more pro-businesses. It is also a prosperous state where demand is not short so that industry can sell more profitably. These conditions do not prevail in all states so that this template may not work everywhere and, especially, in the poorer states. We tried to turn Mumbai into Shanghai and that never worked since models cannot be copied across different socio-political structures.

      " The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is working on new data privacy norms for foreign portfolio investors ( FPIs ). The move comes as the regulations are said to be in conflict with the domestic laws of several countries, especially European nations and Canada, which together account for 40 per cent of total FPI flows into India.The concerns of FPIs relate mostly to the compatibility of Sebi’s new know-your-customer (KYC) requirements with data localisation norms applicable in their home countries. Exemptions for publicly pooled funds along with the creation of a high-end encrypted platform for data exchange and storage are some of the key measures under the regulator’s consideration, said two people aware of the development. The process assumes significance as Sebi had set a March 2019 deadline for FPIs to submit KYC documentation as per the revised rules.Sebi had set up a working committee under Ashok Jhunjhunwala , professor at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras, to look into the matter, said one of the people. The committee will hold a meeting later this week to gather feedback from FPIs and custodians regarding the proposals.The regulator has already exempted Category I FPIs, comprising sovereign wealth funds, from the ambit of new KYC requirements. The regulator is now contemplating the extension of this provision to Category II FPIs as well if they satisfy a few eligibility conditions.Further, funds which get exemption will be asked to collect all the required data and store it in their systems. They will have to provide an undertaking that they have collected all the required KYC data and will share it with Sebi if needed.The encrypted platform that’s being considered is aimed at ensuring such data is not compromised.Until now, FPIs weren’t required to submit sensitive information about their fund managers to Sebi or any other Indian market intermediaries. However, the regulator revised KYC requirements through an April 2018 circular, as a result of which fund managers and senior officials of several FPIs have to submit personal documentation.“Foreign funds have no issues in sharing more information with Sebi \n",

      " However, there are several areas of concern which have to be resolved at the earliest as the deadline for submission of additional KYC documents is fast approaching,” said one of the persons cited above.The regulator had initially suggested the creation of a centralised database by registrars to store KYC data. Market intermediaries could access this after obtaining the concerned FPI’s consent. However, domestic laws pertaining to data localisation in Canada and Europe explicitly restrict information on their nationals being stored overseas.“Under extraordinary scenarios where data of these nationals has to be stored abroad, the agency collecting data needs to give a warranty to the country ensuring safety of the data,” said the second person cited above. “In effect, if Indian law is not amended, Sebi will have to give warranties to foreign governments about the safety of the data even as the database is being maintained by a third-party registrar.”The Sebi circular asked foreign funds to determine beneficial ownership not just based on economic interest but also based on control. Until then, beneficial owners were the ones who owned majority economic interest in the fund. However, due to the change in the method, several fund managers and senior officials of the fund ended up becoming the beneficial owners.This led to panic among FPIs and forced Sebi to rethink its stance. The interim report submitted by the HR Khanled committee on FPIs recommended that Sebi should use this definition of beneficial ownership only for KYC purposes and not for determining control of the fund. That means the KYC requirements should only be applicable to the fund managers of leading FPIs where there is no significant beneficial owner. \n",

The industry itself wasn’t directly represented, there was DSCI, which was sort of semi industry, but you know NASSCOM wasn’t and others weren’t. So, that is one, the e-commerce thing is another example, where again you know it was a selective pick of what they identified as the Indian e-commerce players,” Roy said. \n",

      " He explained that the problem in this was that it was excluding more than 85% of the market by market share. “Basically they said, no Google, Facebook, no Amazon, Flipkart, WalMart, none of the card network companies, no PayPal, nobody. So, it was really a number of smaller players and you know Paytm, which was kind of the biggest names here and Snap deal and so on.” He explained that when the e-commerce policy process began, they reached out to NASSCOM for a list of e-commerce companies. “So we gave all the names of e-commerce, payments etc. They said no, no we want Indian companies. That’s when we asked, what is an Indian company? Because at that time, Flipkart was sort of Indian company despite being 75%…At heart you are Indian is a Sachin Bansal’s statement which I am quoting.

      " Recent events in large companies like ICICI Bank and Infosys has brought the issues of corporate governance to the fore. The primary role of the board is to keep the company honest. While the board needs to support the management in strategy and execution, they also need to provide the required oversight in protecting the value system of the company. In both the instances the board was overawed by charismatic CEOs thereby failing to protect the interests of its stakeholders.In both these cases, the board rushed to give clean chit to the management at the first instance. It is only later when the issues became larger and larger that proper investigations were done and action followed. It is to be noted that in ICICI’s case, the conflict of interest issues was flagged to the board by an investor in 2016.In the public markets, the PE (priceearnings ratio) of a company is a function of both earnings and the comfort factor. Investors want honesty and transparency. They understand that businesses go through ups and downs. What they don’t like are surprises and any ethical issues which will destroy the “trust factor”.The current ICICI board has done the right thing by conducting an investigation by a former Supreme Court judge and based on its recommendation sacked the CEO and clawed back the entitlements paid to her by the bank.In the case of Infosys, the earlier board dismissed lack of approvals by the board and its committees on the severance payment to its ex-CFO as bookkeeping issues and failed to clearly justify the reason for such high payment. Now, Infosys has paid a consent fee of ?34 lakh to Sebi, which found the severance payment was not in accordance with the remuneration policy of the company \n",

Given the rapidly rising disparities in the economy, we need to raise much more from direct taxes and reduce indirect taxes because indirect taxes tend to be inflationary. The poor and the middle classes are more affected by the indirect taxes than direct taxes so it is the indirect taxes that need to be reduced. Further, as argued above, we need to simplify GST to help the unorganized sector. I would even suggest that rates of tax above an income of Rs.1 crore (100 times the per capita income) should be raised and wealth taxation should be reintroduced.

      " AK: It is necessary in the Indian economy to increase private investment. Public investment is constrained by the requirement of keeping the fiscal deficit low. Since, tax revenues are not increasing rapidly capital expenditures cannot rise quickly enough. Private sector investment depends on profitability and for that demand has to be revived. RBI data shows that capacity utilsation is running at around 75%. Unless this rises to around 90%, private investment will not take off. If employment is generated in the unorganized sector and through investment in employment generating areas like, education, health and rural infrastructure, then demand would rise and industry will invest more. Tax concessions to businesses is unlikely to boost investment unless demand rises. When there is spare capacity more investment will only lead to losses and cut back on investment. \n",

The second is to revive investment. The Economic Survey and Budget Speech must, as in the past, reflect thinking on critical issues and not score brownie points. For example the PMEAC has rightly said that Arvind Subrahmanian's critique of GDP changes us silly, since estimating a relationship between GDP and some variables in the past misses the point that productivity is rising, but more serious critiques, like those of the Expert Group under Sudipto Mandal and past members of the Statistical Commission, have been ignored.

But this should be accompanied by elimination of tax concessions and preferences.  In fact, the government has been pursuing too many objectives through tax policy which opens up avenues for evasion and avoidance and distort the resources in unintended ways.  Take the case of deduction for insurance.  It does not benefit anyone except the insurance companies.  Is it the objective of tax policy to encourage insurance companies?  The people expected do not get any benefit.  Most poor and middle income people do not buy insurance and claim deduction.  Only the rich take it and this is not a measure to ensure better health services but simply expanding insurance.  Why should the government give tax concessions to selected saving instruments?  In fact, if one saves for five years, his marginal tax benefit from additional saving is zero and he simply rolls the savings over to claim deduction!  The examples can be multiplied. \n",

      " While discussing “India’s theory of technology policy in the first panel, Snapdeal’s senior vice president of corporate affairs and communication, Rajnish Wahi had said, “When a certain set of companies or countries get success, they try to frame the rules as per what suits them.” Maheshwari went back into history, saying that on 6th of August 1999, the government said that you cannot use more than 40 bit encryption on the Internet for data in transit, and if you do, you will have to take government permission and deposit the decryption keys with them. “So that was the DoT, and later on the same clause was introduced in all the telecom licenses”. Then in 2000, SEBI issued a circular about online trading and said that can use 64/128 width encryption and then it had asterisk, and that mentioned the encryption norms as described by DOT. As an entity, one didn’t know whether to follow SEBI or DoT, or even whether it was 64 bit encryption or 128 bit. In 2001, when online banking started, RBI said that they will use minimum 128 bit encryption. When IRCTC issued its first online ticket, “I think in 2003 or so, about 23 of them that day and they have been using minimum 128 width encryption right from day one. ” Maheshwari’s point was that while buying an IRCTC ticket, for which you have to make a payment, you have to comply with RBI and DOT, which had differential norms. If you’re doing online stock trading, you have to comply with SEBI and DOT. \n",

      " Comparing the two regulators, Kumar likened the TRAI to Virat Kohli, the captain of India’s Cricket Team, and the RBI to the West Indies’ ageing Cricketer Chris Gayle, saying “You know how Gayle plays. Chris Gayle basically gets his right leg out of the way and swings with the ball, it’s successful; it works most of the time [but not all the time]. You have seen how Virat Kohli plays, right and Virat Kohli gets to the pitch of the ball, watches the ball, train hard, Chris Gayle barely trains, gets to the pitch of the ball, drives it, adjust his technique whatever, what I am saying is RBI is a bit like Chris Gayle, RBI has spent the bulk of its existence dealing with banks and its word is the law of the banks.

The government spared small deals from the CCI ambit last year. Companies need not notify the CCI if the assets of the target firm is Rs 350 crore or less or the turnover is up to Rs 1,000 crore. This substantially reduced the work load and prompted the government recently to cut the strength of the CCI board from seven to four, including the chairman. \n",

Corporate affairs secretary Injeti Srinivas is learnt to be spearheading this initiative. The move assumes significance, as companies — and sometimes regulators — in sectors like banking, telecom and shipping have in the past sparred with the CCI over jurisdiction. For instance, analysts said, in a case filed with the CCI by Consumer Online Foundation against Tata Sky and some others around 2011, CCI’s jurisdiction was challenged by DTH operators on the basis that only Trai had exclusive jurisdiction over issues relating to them. But the CCI made it clear that competition-related matters squarely fall within its ambit. \n",

      " MUMBAI: ‘Bond tap’, which gives corporates the flexibility to time the market, prune cost, and dramatically cut down on paperwork for raising money, will soon be a reality in India.Capital market regulator Sebi is preparing the ground to allow ‘on tap public issue of bonds’ — a mechanism that will let corporates use stock exchanges to sell bonds directly to investors, including retail investors, any time and as many times during a financial year, after filing a single prospectus.“After filing the tap bond issue prospectus, a corporate can decide when to enter the market. It can be multiple times during a financial year depending on the fund need and market appetite... as the name suggests, it’s turning the tap on or off. Such issuances could be a cheaper, and certainly a far quicker way to raise debt capital,” a person aware of the plan told ET.“It’s like a secondary sale of a primary issuance, similar to an offer for sale in PSU divestments. The stock exchange platform would be used to invite investors,” he said.According to a Sebi official, the regulator is exploring the basic framework for ‘on tap public issue’ and may soon invite feedback from market participants on the subject.On tap issues would offer greater leeway than shelf-prospectus which currently allows corporates to issue bonds by using the same document multiple times. In ‘tap’, unlike a ‘shelf ’, a string of formalities like dealing with the registrar, merchant banker, or issuing new advertisements and application forms can be done away with. On tap market, which thrives in financial centres like London, would particularly benefit certain sectors like non-depositing taking non-banking finance companies which are regular issuers, said Kaushik Mukherjee, partner at the law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas.“On tap market can also benefit small issuers who otherwise find the cost of fund raising prohibitive \n",

      " MUMBAI: Two domestic shareholders of UTI Asset Management Co — State Bank of India SBI ) and Life Insurance Corporation of India ( LIC ) — have sought more time from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to divest their stake in the asset manager but the market regulator has declined them an extension of time, said people with knowledge of the matter.Last year in March, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) introduced a cross-holding limit in mutual funds to eliminate potential conflicts of interest. A shareholder with 10 per cent or more in an asset management company (AMC) in India cannot hold a similar-sized stake in another fund house and would also have to give up board seats.According to this rule, UTI AMC’s local partners have to pare their stakes to less than 10 per cent each by the end of this month. SBI and LIC hold 18.5 per cent each in UTI AMC, as do Punjab National Bank and Bank of Baroda. The rule applies to all four. US asset manager T Rowe Price holds the balance 26 per cent stake.“Both the shareholders have placed their request before Sebi and also met the regulator regarding this issue \n",

      " But Sebi has informally told them that it is not inclined to give any extension,” said a person familiar with the development.The stakeholders may seek government intervention in the matter.“Since Sebi is unlikely to give an extension, the shareholders may seek the finance ministry’s intervention,” said another person.Sebi, SBI and LIC didn’t respond to queries.All shareholders want to take UTI AMC public and have been waiting for the finance ministry’s approval for the past two years.They think an initial public offering (IPO) is the most efficient and value-added option to reduce the sponsor’s stake.“The draft prospectus has not been filed yet and a new CEO has also not been appointed,” said another person close to the development.UTI AMC is in the process of appointing a new CEO. The board is being assisted by an executive search firm in the recruitment process and it has shortlisted a few candidates. The board is yet to meet and approve the name of the potential candidate.UTI AMC was formed in 2003 when the government was forced to restructure Unit Trust of India (UTI) following a payments crisis. UTI’s assured-return schemes were transferred to the Special Undertaking of UTI (SUUTI) and the rest to UTI AMC.Subsequently, the four domestic shareholders bought out the government’s stake in the fund house for Rs 1,250 crore.When the fund house was formed, the four shareholders were temporary custodians as they had also started their own asset management companies. When UTI AMC came into existence the government had indicated to the sponsors that they would have to eventually pare down their holding. \n",

      " If auditor resigning after questioning a particular transaction is not an early warning, then what is?” asked a banking and finance analyst requesting not to be identified.Investigations by Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO), the investigation arm of the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA), revealed that the banking regulator could have done more before the debt crisis of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS).In its charge sheet filed in a Mumbai court in the IL&FS Financial Services (IFIN) case, the SFIO said that timely intervention by RBI could detected the crisis earlier. It said some of the issues were raised as late as during the 2017 quarterly Reserve Bank of India review.ET had on June 21 reported that BSR & Associates, the KPMG network firm, in a written statement to SFIO said it had written to the RBI, seeking clarity on lending within the IL&FS Group about a month after its debt crisis came to the fore.The latest regulatory action against Deloitte , EY and KPMG, has seen auditors scampering to de-risk themselves and more differences between auditors and managements will come to the fore in companies with dodgy accounting policies that fail to provide evidence and justifications for their decisions.People in the know say that auditors taking a stand have also led to conflicts with the management. In some cases like Reliance Capital, Manpasand, Vakrangee, Fortis Healthcare, IL&FS Transportation Networks Ltd (ITNL) and in situations like Jet Airways, where the auditor-management tussle went on for a month, the incoming auditors had different interpretations of key issues and conflicts were laid bare.In one of the companies where where an auditor resigned, there are also issues with a group company. According to a person close to the development, while in one case the same transaction has been questioned, in another, the transaction has been impaired or written off. Both the group companies are audited by different auditors. \n",

      " Queries to RBI and Sebi went unanswered.Some experts said Sebi was right in writing such a letter. “In an anonymous ordermatching system, the sanctity of trades is critical because millions of investors, whether trading in the stock or not, are impacted by any unnatural intervention,” said Sandeep Parekh , founder, Finsec Law Advisors.“In the recent example, when foreign investors were asked not to complete executed trades, their counterparts would be innocent investors who are hurt in the process. Even otherwise, there is nothing critical or even important in breaching these limits. These can easily be corrected the next business day by issuing a direction disallowing further purchases till the position is restored,” said Finsec’s Parekh, a former executive director of Sebi.Typically, foreign investment limits are monitored at the end of the day. But on February 17, when the window was opened for fresh purchases in HDFC Bank stock, RBI started collecting the data from stock exchanges, custodians and market participants at frequent intervals.Frenzied buying by foreign portfolio investors in the HDFC Bank stock led to the statutory limit being crossed within a few hours and midway through the trading day, RBI clamped down on them. By then, many trades had already been executed, prompting the central bank to ask all custodians not to settle trades in HDFC Bank made after 1:39 pm on February 17 in which foreigners were buyers.Trades that were not confirmed by the custodians have devolved on the stock brokers that executed the transactions on behalf of foreign clients.“From an RBI perspective, it was a damage-control exercise since a delayed notification post the close of market hours would have resulted in more brokers punching in the trades, which later they would have had to take in their own proprietary books,” said Tejesh Chitlangi, partner, IC Legal . “Also, not to forget that a regulator would be inclined to immediately stop breach of its regulations, once it gets established.” \n",

Its founder NR Narayana Murthy always put value before profits. His statement that clear conscience is the softest pillow is legendary. Despite criticism from different quarters, he questioned the board and its management as his silence would have mortally wounded the core value system of the company. People close to him clearly understood the pain he went through when Infosys was accused of mis-governance. The recent settlement clearly vindicates his position. The least the company can do is to apologise to Murthy for the communication it issued to the stock exchanges that blamed him of interference. Also, there should be accountability for such lapses by the board. Trust in the management of a company and its board is essential to build a vibrant capital market .

      " The current panel consists of retired Bombay High Court judge Vijay C Daga, former Reserve Bank deputy governor Anand Sinha, Raval and Ramesh.“Considering the sensitivity of the case, everything will have to be looked into by Sebi and how to address these issues,” said a person close to the development. Lawyers said Sebi rules require a quorum of three to decide on any consent case.That poses a problem. “In the event of the committee being of less than three people, the committee would legally be unable to decide the case,” said Sandeep Parekh, founder of Finsec Law Advisors. “Sebi will have to see whether it is willing to create an alternate bench like in the judiciary to make a quorum excluding the recused members by inviting a new member for a specific case.”Introduced in 2007, Sebi’s consent mechanism is modelled on the lines of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s settlement system, offering quick remedies to cases that can otherwise get entangled in long-drawn litigation. It is a negotiation platform between the regulator and the entity without admission or denial of guilt.The consent involves the party paying a settlement amount and, in some cases, agreeing to undertake certain restrictions voluntarily after suggestions from Sebi.The consent process involves several stages. Once the settlement terms are agreed upon by the regulator and the entity, it is then placed before the independent advisory committee, which after examining the terms either recommends them, rejects them or suggests modifications.Based on the panel’s recommendations, Sebi’s two whole-time members then pass the final order, which is binding on the applicant and can be only challenged by a third party investor impacted by the consent.“If the members have finished the term of three years or where public perception appears to be compromised by an interest held by a member, Sebi can technically reconstitute the committee,” said Sumit Agrawal, partner, Suvan Law Advisors. \n",
