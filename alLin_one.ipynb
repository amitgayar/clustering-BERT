On the issue of mega alliance before Lok Sabha elections 2019, Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that most alliances were on track but the idea of an alliance was unanimously rejected by the party unit in Delhi. Rahul Gandhi also highlighted concerns of some family members of the martyred jawans who had asked for proof of the damage caused by the air strikes conducted by the Indian Air Force (IAF) in Balakot region of Pakistan. \n",

      " The Rafale deal has been the subject of heated claims and counter-claims on two broad issues — that the contract to purchase 36 French multi-role fighter aircraft was grossly overvalued and that it was tainted by crony capitalism. Ammunition for the second charge came from an unexpected quarter with former French President François Hollande stating in an interview that it was India that suggested the Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Defence Ltd. as the offset partner for the deal. This squarely contradicts what the Modi government has been saying all along. While the Centre has insisted that the choice of offset partners is entirely that of the manufacturer, or of Dassault Aviation, Mr. Hollande’s remarks were widely perceived as bolstering the Congress allegation that the Rafale deal was structured to favour one industrialist. In the storm that ensued, the clarificatory statements issued — by the Centre, the French Foreign Ministry and Dassault — did little to clearly address what Mr. Hollande had said. The Defence Ministry’s statement merely reiterated that governments have no role in offset contracts, which are purely commercial. The French government said pretty much the same thing, and Dassault’s statement reaffirmed that it had chosen to tie up with Reliance Defence. But all this merely begs the question: did the Centre suggest a partnership with Reliance Defence as Mr. Hollande said? Also, if so, what form did it take? A firm nudge in that direction? A quiet whisper in someone’s ear? Who suggested to who? And when? It remains to be seen whether Mr. Hollande will now choose to complete his half-finished remarks to the French investigative website. \n",

      " The findings of the team acquire significance because these were the arguments presented to the Supreme Court by the NDA government citing why the Rafale deal signed under the current political dispensation is better off than the earlier agreement. The benchmark price — a number discovered in advance by financial experts which acts as a ceiling on the finally negotiated price of the whole package — for the aircraft and its weapons combined was originally fixed at €5.06 billion, but it ultimately shot up to €7.87 billion — an escalation by 55.6 percent above the benchmark. The Hindu reported: \"It is highlighted that the initial commercial offer from the French side was for firm and fixed price which was converted to price based on escalation formula during the price negotiations. The benchmark price prepared by INT was for firm and fixed price and not adjusted to price based on escalation formula. The final price offered by the French Government (which is escalation based) is 55.6% above the benchmark (which is for firm and fixed price). Considering the future escalations till the time of delivery, the gap in the benchmark and the final price would further increase. Minor adjustments towards costs of Technical Publications, Advance Training of IAF Pilots and Technicians and Role Equipment would not make much dent to this huge gap.\" \n",

First, is there a difference in the cost of planes in the first and the second contract (signed with a French firm) and did India pay more or less money as per the second contract? And, has the industrialist (whose company has formed a joint venture with the French firm), who was given the contract, ever manufactured planes?\" Further, he said, “And a more important question, did you follow the due government procedure? Why the (then) defence minister (Manohar Parrikar) was seen catching fish in Goa? And, was an approval from the Cabinet Committee on Security taken (for the mega deal)? Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley hit back at Rahul, saying unlike during Congress regimes when middlemen ruled the roost, there was no “Quattrocchi\" in the contract for the Rafale fighter jet.

It promised that the new deal to acquire 36 Rafale jets in flyaway condition through an inter-governmental agreement would be on “terms that would be better than conveyed by Dassault Aviation as part of a separate process under way” and that the delivery would be in “a time frame that would be compatible with the operational requirement of the IAF.” \n",

      " After winning a slender majority in the 32-member legislative assembly, a Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) delegation led by its president P S Golay on Saturday called on Governor Ganga Prasad and staked claim to form the next government in the state. The SKM leaders, however, were tight-lipped about the name of their legislature party chief. The SKM, founded in 2013, won a slender majority in the 32-member legislative assembly by bagging 17 seats against 15 won by the SDF. Speaking to the media on the Raj Bhawan premises after meeting the Governor, Golay said his party has requested Prasad to invite the SKM to form the next government in Sikkim. To a query on who will become the chief minister, he said a decision about it will be made soon. SKM sources said its legislature party has authorized Golay to decide on the chief minister's issue. \n",

If you have the courage, in this Monsoon Session, please make a suo moto statement and reply to the nation about how the defence ministry has conducted the biggest scam under your nose,\" Congress spokesperson Sushmita Dev had said. Gandhi said he had asked the French president Emmanuel Macron about the Indian government's claim that it cannot share the price details due to a secrecy pact between India and France. The French leader told him that there was no such pact, he claimed. After his statement, France said a security agreement it concluded with India in 2008 legally binds the two countries to protect the classified information relating to operational capabilities of defence equipment. However, it did not specifically mention whether the classified information included details of the pricing, over which the Congress has made allegations. \n",

The three officials pointed out in their note that the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) stipulated that in all cases the Contract Negotiating Committee “should establish a benchmark and reasonableness of price in an Internal Meeting before opening the Commercial Offer.” In this case, the Defence Acquisition Council had directed on August 28 and September 1, 2015 that the benchmark price should be decided and finalised by the INT before starting price negotiations.

Furthermore, it also turns out that the Modi government's 36-jet deal won't get the aircraft to India much sooner than the UPA's deal would have. The actual advantage would be of a month in terms of delivery. This technically tallies with the government's claims that NDA's deal will bring the jets home faster, but a one-month advantage isn't anything to write home about. However, it must be mentioned here that the delivery schedule of the first 18 Rafale aircraft will beat the UPA's deal by five months, according to the CAG report. \n",

      " AHMEDABAD: The BJP won all the 26 Lok Sabha seats at stake in Gujarat as the people in the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi stood firmly behind him for the second time after 2014.The BJP got a vote share of over 62 per cent in Gujarat and the minimum margin of its victory was 1.27 lakh votes, reflecting the massive scale of saffron sweep.Like in 2014, the Congress failed to open its account this time around also.The Rahul Gandhi-led party had put up a spirited fight in the 2017 assembly polls in Gujarat, but failed to carry forward the momentum in the 2019 general election.While Modi did not contest election from the state this time, BJP chief Amit Shah, who also hails from Gujarat, won by a huge margin from Gandhingar in his maiden Lok Sabha election foray.In 2014, Modi had won from Vadodara, but vacated the seat later and retained Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, his second Lok Sabha constituency.The process of counting of votes continued till Friday morning and the last result came at around 10 am.Declaration of results took time due to counting of VVPAT (Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail) slips, said a poll official.The VVPAT enables the verification of results displayed from the EVM during counting.Shah won from Gandhinagar -- a seat earlier held by BJP patriarch L K Advani -- by 5.57 lakh votes, defeating Congress rival C J Chavda.Shah polled 8.94 lakh votes, while Chavda got 3.37 lakh ballots.In 2014, the BJP had won all the 26 seats when Modi, the then Gujarat chief minister, was the BJP's prime ministerial candidate.This time when he was in contention for a second term as Prime Minister, the voters of the state firmly stood behind him.The victory margin of the BJP's Navsari candidate, C R Patil -- 6.89 lakh -- was the highest in all the 26 seats.Patil had won the 2014 Lok Sabha election from Navsari by a margin of 5.58 lakh votes.In Vadodara, BJP candidate Ranjan Bhatt won by a margin of over 5.84 lakh votes against Congress's Prashant Patel.Notably, she has crossed Modi's victory margin of 5.70 lakh in the 2014 elections from Vadodara.In Surat, BJP's Darshana Jardosh won by 5.48 lakh votes, defeating Congress candidate Ashok Patel.In Jamnagar, BJP's Poonam Madam won by over 2.36 lakh votes, defeating Congress candidate Mulu Kandoriya.BJP's Mitesh Patel won from Anand, defeating Congress candidate and former Union minister Bharat Solanki by a margin of 1.97 lakh votes.In Bardoli, BJP's Parbhu Vasava defeated Congress candidate Tushar Chaudhary by 2.15 lakh votes.BJP candidate from Chhota Udepur, Gitaben Rathva, won by a margin of 3.77 lakh votes, defeating Congress candidate Ranjitsinh Rathva.BJP's Mohan Kundariya won the Rajkot seat by a margin of 3.68 lakh votes, defeating Congress's Lalit Kagathara.BJP candidates won by over 3 lakh votes inValsad, Panchmahal, Kheda, Kutch, Ahmedabad (East), Ahmedabad (West), Banaskantha, Bharuch and Bhavnagar.The lowest victory gap of a BJP candidate was in Dhahod, where its nominee Jaswantsinh Bhabhor, a minister in the Modi government, won by 1.27 lakh votes.Expressing happiness over the BJP's grand victory, chief minister Vijay Rupani said the credit for this outcome goes to the people of the state.\"Political pundits could not see the Modi wave until the exit polls Today this wave is clear from the results.\"It is the victory of the people of the country \n",

      " No questions have been raised about the capabilities of the Rafale jet, and the corruption allegations have persisted in the absence — unlike in the case of some other defence deals such as Bofors — of a financial trail. But a fair part of the reason for the concerns about the deal relate to process. If it was the temptation to make a headline-grabbing announcement that led Prime Minister Modi to unexpectedly announce the decision to purchase 36 Rafale aircraft, during his France visit in April 2015, it was a bad mistake. It is true that the deal was signed only in September 2016, after clearance from the Cabinet Committee on Security, but Mr. Modi’s 2015 declaration of a new deal clearly caught even many of his senior officials unawares, who were labouring under the belief that negotiations for the purchase of 126 Rafale aircraft, initiated by the UPA government, were still on. As things stand, greater transparency is the only way to clear the air. Private briefings to Opposition leaders and the disclosure of all information that doesn’t jeopardise national security or impact the aircrafts’ operational capability are good starting points. The decision to reject the formation of a Joint Parliamentary Committee to examine the deal should be reconsidered. If the political war over Rafale continues, it is defence modernisation that will become the real victim. \n",

This replaced the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime’s decision to buy 126 Rafale aircraft, 108 of which were to be made in India by state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. The deal has become controversial with the opposition, led by the Congress, claiming that the price at which India is buying Rafale aircraft now is ?1,670 crore for each, three times the Rs 526 crore, the initial bid by the company when the UPA regime was trying to buy the aircraft. The Congress has also claimed that the deal was changed to benefit Anil Ambani, whose Reliance Defence is an offset partner of Dassault Aviation. The government has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the contract. It has also said it has no role in Dassault’s choice of offset partners. \n",

      " The Congress slammed the Modi government for compromising national security and alleged that a huge scam was brewing in the procurement of Rafale fighter aircraft for the Indian Air Force. The Congress said that the Modi government signed the Rafale deal on September 23, 2016, for the purchase of 36 Rafale fighter aircraft from Dassault for approximately Rs 58,000 crore and on October 3, Reliance Defence Limited, owned by Anil Ambani, tied up with the French company for a Joint venture for defence production in India. The Congress cited a Reliance document to point out that off-sets in the deal, which are half the cost of 36 aircraft, work out to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore. “That means the deal is worth Rs 60,000 crore,” said Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, adding the government did not part with any information related to the deal despite several attempts by his party. Non-transparency in the deal also denied the transfer of technology to the public sector Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, the Congress further said. \n",

      "  NEW DELHI: A fresh political storm seems to be brewing over the 36 Rafale jet deal after French media portal Mediapart claimed that it was in possession of a document by Dassault Aviation which said that an “alliance” with the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Defence as a “counterpart” was “imperative and mandatory” to clinch the fighter jet deal with India.The French media portal in its report said the Dassault Aviation’s document was based on what the aircraft manufacturer’s deputy CEO Loïk Segalen said during a presentation of the Dassault Reliance Aerospace joint venture to staff representatives in Nagpur in May 2017.“It was imperative and mandatory for Dassault Aviation to accept this counterpart in order to get the contract,” the report quoted the purported document as saying.The Modi government has consistently denied any government role in the offsets part of the Rafale contract, with top officials saying on record that a selection of Indian partners was an independent choice of French companies.Translations of the report, written in French, are being monitored by the Indian government, even as Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and advocate Prashant Bhushan pitched the media report against the government on social media sites.Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman left for France on Wednesday night on a three-day visit which comes amid a massive controversy over the procurement of 36 Rafale jets from Dassault Aviation.Officials sources said Sitharaman will hold wide-ranging talks with her French counterpart Florence Parly on ways to deepen strategic cooperation between the two countries and the two sides will also deliberate on major regional and global issues of mutual interests. \n",

      " Reacting to the controversy, the French government said a global settlement was reached between the French tax authorities and Reliance FLAG, in a tax dispute pertaining to the period 2008-2012. “This settlement was conducted in full adherence with the legislative and regulatory framework governing this common practice of the tax administration. It was not subject to any political interference,” French Ambassador to India Alexandre Zeigler tweeted. The Le Monde report revealed that Anil Ambani’s French telecom company was under scrutiny. “The company was investigated by the French tax authorities and was found liable to pay Euro 60 million in taxes for the period 2007 to 2010. Reliance offered to pay Euro 7.6 million as a settlement. The French tax authorities refused. They conducted another investigation for the period 2010 to 2012 and asked for an additional Euro 91 million in taxes,” tweeted Julien Bouissou, the South Asia correspondent for Le Monde, who wrote the story with Anne Michel. By the time Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the plans to buy Rafale fighter jets from Dassault in April 2015, the Anil Ambani-firm had owed about Euro 151 million to the French government. However, six months after Modi’s Rafale announcement, in October 2015, the French tax authorities accepted only Euro 7.3 million from Reliance as a settlement, instead of the much bigger sum of Euro 151 million, Le Monde reported. \n",

The final price offered by the French Government (which is escalation based) is 55.6% above the benchmark (which is for firm and fixed price).

It won’t be a witch-hunt,” Gandhi told Outlook in an exclusive interview. He said the Rafale deal is ‘seriously problematic” and it needs to be investigated.

      " NEW DELHI: Congress President Rahul Gandhi expressed \"regret\" in the Supreme Court on Monday over his remarks in connection with the Rafale judgment, which the apex court had said was \"incorrectly attributed\" to it, saying it was made in the \"heat of political campaigning\".The apex court on April 15 had given a categorical clarification that in its Rafale verdict there was no occasion for it to make a mention of the contemptuous observation that \" chowkidar Narendra Modi chor hain\" as has been attributed to it by Gandhi.The court had directed Gandhi to give his explanation on April 22 on a petition filed by BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi seeking criminal contempt action against him for his remarks It is scheduled to hear Lekhi's petition on Tuesday.Gandhi, who filed an affidavit in response to the apex court's order, said his statement was \"purely political\" and was made to counter the \"misinformation campaign\" being led by senior BJP functionaries as well as the Government that the December 14 last year judgment gave a \"clean chit\" to the Modi government on the Rafale deal.He also referred to a media interview by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in which he had said that the apex court had given a clean chit to the government in the Rafale deal.He maintained that there was no \"slightest intention\" to \"insinuate\" anything regarding the Supreme Court proceedings in any manner as he holds the top court in the highest esteem.Clarifying further, Gandhi said he had made the statement after filing his nomination paper on April 10 without \"having seen or read the order\" of the apex court passed on that day relating to the admissibility of certain documents related to the Rafale case in the review petition.However, on the issue of slogan 'Chowkidar chor hai', Gandhi in his affidavit re-affirmed his stand and belief and that of his party that Rafale deal is a \"tainted transaction\" and a \"gross and brazen abuse of executive power and a leading example of the corruption of the BJP Government led by Prime Minister Modi, which deserves to be investigated thoroughly by a Joint Parliamentary Committee and proceeded against thereafter\".He maintained that criminal contempt petition filed by Lekhi is seeking to drag the court into a \"political controversy for personal gains and political mileage\" with ulterior motive to gag him in a political discourse in the ongoing elections.Gandhi said on April 10, his political statement and issues relating to court proceedings \"unfortunately got juxtaposed and mingled with a political slogan being used extensively\" by Congress party as well as by him for the last several months, \"which is a matter of intense and frenzied public debate during the ongoing Lok Sabha elections\".In his 26-page affidavit, he said: \"My statement was made in the heat of political campaigning It has been used (and misused) by my political opponents to project that I had deliberately and intentionally suggested that this Court had said 'Chowkidar Chor Hai' \n",

      " NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court refused to order an investigation of the Rafale deal , citing the inherent limitations of its power to undertake a judicial review of “sensitive” defence contracts and its lack of expertise in scrutinising pricing or technical feasibility The move was welcomed by the government and condemned by its critics.The bench led by chief justice of India Ranjan Gogoi dismissed pleas to order a probe into corruption allegations by former ministers Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie among others.“We are satisfied that there is no occasion to really doubt the process, and even if minor deviations have occurred that would not result in either setting aside the contract or requiring a detailed scrutiny by the court,” the bench said “We find no reason for any intervention on the sensitive issue of purchase of 36 defence aircraft… Perception of individuals cannot be the basis of a fishing and roving enquiry by this court, especially in such matters.”The petitioners alleged that the government had pulled a 2001deal to buy 126 jets at a lower price only to conclude a fresh deal in 2015 to buy 36 jets at a higher price The government disputed this claim, saying the cost escalation was on account of add-ons in terms of avionics and armaments.The petitioners alleged a conspiracy at the highest level to defraud the exchequer and favour the Anil Ambani group chosen as offset partner by French aviation company Dassault, which makes the Rafale Congress president Rahul Gandhi had made the Rafale deal his main point of attack related to corruption against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP ahead of the recent assembly polls, which saw the Congress beating its rival in three states.Sinha, Shourie and the other petitioners said they were disappointed that the court had taken a “conservative view of judicial review” in cases alleging corruption in defence deals involving high functionaries.The petitioners were “shocked the judgment is based on completely false information about the CAG (Comptroller and Auditor General) report: No CAG report on Rafale has been submitted or examined,” they said in a joint statement They were also “shocked that court accepts Mukesh Ambani’s RIL as ‘parent company’ of Anil Ambani’s Reliance Defence.” They said fresh disclosures are expected soon.The other members of the bench, justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and KM Joseph, gave a concurring judgement The court rejected all objections to three aspects of the deal — decision-making, prices and the India offset partner.It also rejected a plea that the inter-government agreement (IGA) had been invoked out of turn The court said that it was informed that joint exercises had taken place, and that there was a financial advantage to the nation The court said defence procurement contracts should be subject to a different degree of scrutiny.The processes have been broadly followed, it said \n",

Action Points: 1.Informing Parliament about the price is a national security threat, 2.Brand all who ask, Anti National.” Congress president Rahul Gandhi accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of protecting those behind alleged corruption in the Rafale deal. He noted that it is for the first time that the Defence Minister is saying \"we will not tell the country\". \"This is the biggest deal for the backbone of the Air Force, but Defence Minister says we will not tell the country as it is a secret, under a deal struck in Paris\". Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma also alleged there was a big scam in the Rafale deal as the price at which the planes were negotiated were four times higher and benefitted private firms. The Centre then came out with a detailed statement rebutting Congress’ allegations. The Modi administration said the current deal “is better in terms of capability, price, equipment, delivery, maintenance, training, etc than that notionally negotiated by the then government (UPA II) in a process it could not conclude in ten years”. \n",

India and France signed a deal worth 7.87 billion euros (Rs 59,000 crore approximately) on September 23, 2016, for 36 Rafale jets. The delivery of the aircraft will start from September 2019. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who recently got back to North Block after recovering from his kidney transplant, has countered Gandhi's claims on Twitter. \"Any issue diversion by @RahulGandhi on my Rafale questions, will not wipe out his falsehood on Rafale,\" he tweeted yesterday. In another tweet he claimed that \"The fully weaponised Rafale air craft's 2016 price is 20% cheaper than the 2007 offer.
