      " AHMEDABAD: The BJP won all the 26 Lok Sabha seats at stake in Gujarat as the people in the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi stood firmly behind him for the second time after 2014.The BJP got a vote share of over 62 per cent in Gujarat and the minimum margin of its victory was 1.27 lakh votes, reflecting the massive scale of saffron sweep.Like in 2014, the Congress failed to open its account this time around also.The Rahul Gandhi-led party had put up a spirited fight in the 2017 assembly polls in Gujarat, but failed to carry forward the momentum in the 2019 general election.While Modi did not contest election from the state this time, BJP chief Amit Shah, who also hails from Gujarat, won by a huge margin from Gandhingar in his maiden Lok Sabha election foray.In 2014, Modi had won from Vadodara, but vacated the seat later and retained Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, his second Lok Sabha constituency.The process of counting of votes continued till Friday morning and the last result came at around 10 am.Declaration of results took time due to counting of VVPAT (Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail) slips, said a poll official.The VVPAT enables the verification of results displayed from the EVM during counting.Shah won from Gandhinagar -- a seat earlier held by BJP patriarch L K Advani -- by 5.57 lakh votes, defeating Congress rival C J Chavda.Shah polled 8.94 lakh votes, while Chavda got 3.37 lakh ballots.In 2014, the BJP had won all the 26 seats when Modi, the then Gujarat chief minister, was the BJP's prime ministerial candidate.This time when he was in contention for a second term as Prime Minister, the voters of the state firmly stood behind him.The victory margin of the BJP's Navsari candidate, C R Patil -- 6.89 lakh -- was the highest in all the 26 seats.Patil had won the 2014 Lok Sabha election from Navsari by a margin of 5.58 lakh votes.In Vadodara, BJP candidate Ranjan Bhatt won by a margin of over 5.84 lakh votes against Congress's Prashant Patel.Notably, she has crossed Modi's victory margin of 5.70 lakh in the 2014 elections from Vadodara.In Surat, BJP's Darshana Jardosh won by 5.48 lakh votes, defeating Congress candidate Ashok Patel.In Jamnagar, BJP's Poonam Madam won by over 2.36 lakh votes, defeating Congress candidate Mulu Kandoriya.BJP's Mitesh Patel won from Anand, defeating Congress candidate and former Union minister Bharat Solanki by a margin of 1.97 lakh votes.In Bardoli, BJP's Parbhu Vasava defeated Congress candidate Tushar Chaudhary by 2.15 lakh votes.BJP candidate from Chhota Udepur, Gitaben Rathva, won by a margin of 3.77 lakh votes, defeating Congress candidate Ranjitsinh Rathva.BJP's Mohan Kundariya won the Rajkot seat by a margin of 3.68 lakh votes, defeating Congress's Lalit Kagathara.BJP candidates won by over 3 lakh votes inValsad, Panchmahal, Kheda, Kutch, Ahmedabad (East), Ahmedabad (West), Banaskantha, Bharuch and Bhavnagar.The lowest victory gap of a BJP candidate was in Dhahod, where its nominee Jaswantsinh Bhabhor, a minister in the Modi government, won by 1.27 lakh votes.Expressing happiness over the BJP's grand victory, chief minister Vijay Rupani said the credit for this outcome goes to the people of the state.\"Political pundits could not see the Modi wave until the exit polls Today this wave is clear from the results.\"It is the victory of the people of the country \n",

Instead, the Modi government settled for a Letter of Comfort from the French government. However, a Letter of Comfort provides the original equipment manufacturer — Dassault, in this case — with a lot of legal options, even if it fails to comply with the agreement. \"In case of an IGA (intergovernmental agreement) for 36 Rafale, the offer of M/s DA (Dassault Aviation) in 2007 had included a 15 percent bank guarantee against advance payments, 5 percent each for performance guarantee and warranty.

It was not subject to any political interference,” French Ambassador to India Alexandre Zeigler tweeted.

They conducted another investigation for the period 2010 to 2012 and asked for an additional Euro 91 million in taxes,” tweeted Julien Bouissou, the South Asia correspondent for Le Monde, who wrote the story with Anne Michel. By the time Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the plans to buy Rafale fighter jets from Dassault in April 2015, the Anil Ambani-firm had owed about Euro 151 million to the French government.

      " NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court refused to order an investigation of the Rafale deal , citing the inherent limitations of its power to undertake a judicial review of “sensitive” defence contracts and its lack of expertise in scrutinising pricing or technical feasibility The move was welcomed by the government and condemned by its critics.The bench led by chief justice of India Ranjan Gogoi dismissed pleas to order a probe into corruption allegations by former ministers Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie among others.“We are satisfied that there is no occasion to really doubt the process, and even if minor deviations have occurred that would not result in either setting aside the contract or requiring a detailed scrutiny by the court,” the bench said “We find no reason for any intervention on the sensitive issue of purchase of 36 defence aircraft… Perception of individuals cannot be the basis of a fishing and roving enquiry by this court, especially in such matters.”The petitioners alleged that the government had pulled a 2001deal to buy 126 jets at a lower price only to conclude a fresh deal in 2015 to buy 36 jets at a higher price The government disputed this claim, saying the cost escalation was on account of add-ons in terms of avionics and armaments.The petitioners alleged a conspiracy at the highest level to defraud the exchequer and favour the Anil Ambani group chosen as offset partner by French aviation company Dassault, which makes the Rafale Congress president Rahul Gandhi had made the Rafale deal his main point of attack related to corruption against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP ahead of the recent assembly polls, which saw the Congress beating its rival in three states.Sinha, Shourie and the other petitioners said they were disappointed that the court had taken a “conservative view of judicial review” in cases alleging corruption in defence deals involving high functionaries.The petitioners were “shocked the judgment is based on completely false information about the CAG (Comptroller and Auditor General) report: No CAG report on Rafale has been submitted or examined,” they said in a joint statement They were also “shocked that court accepts Mukesh Ambani’s RIL as ‘parent company’ of Anil Ambani’s Reliance Defence.” They said fresh disclosures are expected soon.The other members of the bench, justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and KM Joseph, gave a concurring judgement The court rejected all objections to three aspects of the deal — decision-making, prices and the India offset partner.It also rejected a plea that the inter-government agreement (IGA) had been invoked out of turn The court said that it was informed that joint exercises had taken place, and that there was a financial advantage to the nation The court said defence procurement contracts should be subject to a different degree of scrutiny.The processes have been broadly followed, it said \n",

      " “The need for the aircraft is not in doubt,” it said “The quality of the aircraft is not in question.”Long-drawn negotiations for the procurement of 126 jets had not produced any result Besides, the court noted that it cannot sit in judgment over the wisdom of deciding to go in for the purchase of 36 aircraft in place of 126 “We cannot possibly compel the government to go in for purchase of 126 aircraft,” it said “Our country cannot afford to be unprepared/underprepared in a situation where our adversaries… have acquired not only fourth generation, but even fifth generation aircrafts, of which we have none It will not be correct to sit as an appellate authority to scrutinise each aspect of the process of acquisition.”The court said it had “examined closely the price details and comparison of prices of the basic aircraft along with escalation costs as under original RFP (request for proposal) as well as under the IGA We have also gone through the explanatory note on the costing, item wise.”The government, the court noted, claimed that there was a commercial advantage in the purchase of 36 Rafale aircrafts apart from a better maintenance and weapon package “It is certainly not the job of this court to carry out a comparison of the pricing details in matters like the present,” it said.On the choice of the Indian offset partner, which triggered the litigation, the court said that the ‘Clarification on Offset Policy’, posted on September 22 makes it clear that the government has no role in it “Such matter is seemingly left to the commercial decision of Dassault,” the bench said.As for the role of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), the court said that the government had argued that Dassault was “circumspect” about the stateowned company being able to carry out its contractual obligations and this was responsible for the earlier deal not being wrapped up “Once again, it is neither appropriate nor within the experience of this court to step into this arena of what is technically feasible or not,” the bench said. \n",

      " The Rafale deal has been the subject of heated claims and counter-claims on two broad issues — that the contract to purchase 36 French multi-role fighter aircraft was grossly overvalued and that it was tainted by crony capitalism. Ammunition for the second charge came from an unexpected quarter with former French President François Hollande stating in an interview that it was India that suggested the Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Defence Ltd. as the offset partner for the deal. This squarely contradicts what the Modi government has been saying all along. While the Centre has insisted that the choice of offset partners is entirely that of the manufacturer, or of Dassault Aviation, Mr. Hollande’s remarks were widely perceived as bolstering the Congress allegation that the Rafale deal was structured to favour one industrialist. In the storm that ensued, the clarificatory statements issued — by the Centre, the French Foreign Ministry and Dassault — did little to clearly address what Mr. Hollande had said. The Defence Ministry’s statement merely reiterated that governments have no role in offset contracts, which are purely commercial. The French government said pretty much the same thing, and Dassault’s statement reaffirmed that it had chosen to tie up with Reliance Defence. But all this merely begs the question: did the Centre suggest a partnership with Reliance Defence as Mr. Hollande said? Also, if so, what form did it take? A firm nudge in that direction? A quiet whisper in someone’s ear? Who suggested to who? And when? It remains to be seen whether Mr. Hollande will now choose to complete his half-finished remarks to the French investigative website. \n",

      " No questions have been raised about the capabilities of the Rafale jet, and the corruption allegations have persisted in the absence — unlike in the case of some other defence deals such as Bofors — of a financial trail. But a fair part of the reason for the concerns about the deal relate to process. If it was the temptation to make a headline-grabbing announcement that led Prime Minister Modi to unexpectedly announce the decision to purchase 36 Rafale aircraft, during his France visit in April 2015, it was a bad mistake. It is true that the deal was signed only in September 2016, after clearance from the Cabinet Committee on Security, but Mr. Modi’s 2015 declaration of a new deal clearly caught even many of his senior officials unawares, who were labouring under the belief that negotiations for the purchase of 126 Rafale aircraft, initiated by the UPA government, were still on. As things stand, greater transparency is the only way to clear the air. Private briefings to Opposition leaders and the disclosure of all information that doesn’t jeopardise national security or impact the aircrafts’ operational capability are good starting points. The decision to reject the formation of a Joint Parliamentary Committee to examine the deal should be reconsidered. If the political war over Rafale continues, it is defence modernisation that will become the real victim. \n",

      " Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said that the Rafale deal negotiated by the government is 9 per cent cheaper than what the Congress had negotiated. In 2015, the government had entered into a deal with France for purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets. However, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has time and again accused the government of buying the planes at a higher price than what the UPA-II had negotiated. In an exclusive interview to news agency ANI, Jaitley today said that Congress had recently made false allegations against the Modi government. \"Mr Rahul Gandhi himself has given seven different prices in different speeches with regard to the Rafale, that is the 2007 offer,\" he said. \n",

He said: \"Are they (Congress) aware of this fact or have their ministers who dealt with it and know the file, told them that if it was a fully weaponised loaded aircraft? Loaded to unloaded, you compare the price again. The 2016 price is 20 per cent cheaper than the 2007 offer. So we got it cheaper.\" \n",

The Congress said that the Modi government signed the Rafale deal on September 23, 2016, for the purchase of 36 Rafale fighter aircraft from Dassault for approximately Rs 58,000 crore and on October 3, Reliance Defence Limited, owned by Anil Ambani, tied up with the French company for a Joint venture for defence production in India. The Congress cited a Reliance document to point out that off-sets in the deal, which are half the cost of 36 aircraft, work out to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore. “That means the deal is worth Rs 60,000 crore,” said Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, adding the government did not part with any information related to the deal despite several attempts by his party. Non-transparency in the deal also denied the transfer of technology to the public sector Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, the Congress further said. \n",
