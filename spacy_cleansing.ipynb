      " After winning a slender majority in the 32-member legislative assembly, a Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) delegation led by its president P S Golay on Saturday called on Governor Ganga Prasad and staked claim to form the next government in the state. The SKM leaders, however, were tight-lipped about the name of their legislature party chief.\n",
      "2 \n",
      " The SKM, founded in 2013, won a slender majority in the 32-member legislative assembly by bagging 17 seats against 15 won by the SDF. Speaking to the media on the Raj Bhawan premises after meeting the Governor, Golay said his party has requested Prasad to invite the SKM to form the next government in Sikkim. To a query on who will become the chief minister, he said a decision about it will be made soon. SKM sources said its legislature party has authorized Golay to decide on the chief minister's issue.\n",
      "3 \n",
      " Though Golay did not contest the polls, the party rank and file want him to become the next chief minister, the sources said. The Governor is learnt to be consulting legal experts about implications of inviting Golay to take oath as the chief minister, given that he was convicted to a year's imprisonment in a corruption case and had served the prison term. He was also disqualified as MLA in 2017. The SKM unseated the Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF) government led by five-time chief minister Pawan Kumar Chamling.\n",

      " As new evidence of interference by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) in the Rafale negotiations appeared in an exclusive story in The Hindu on Friday, the government, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, sought to defend itself by citing then Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar’s file notings, which appeared to downplay the concerns of the then Defence Secretary G. Mohan Kumar.\n",
      "5 \n",
      " The Hindu reported that officials of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had raised a red flag over the PMO’s direct negotiations with the French government that — they noted in the file — undermined the official negotiating team’s position. Below Mr. Kumar’s noting, Mr. Parrikar wrote: “It appears that the PMO and French President’s office are monitoring the progress of issues which was an outcome of the summit meeting and Para 5 appears to be an overreaction. Def Sec may resolve issue/matter in consultation with the Pr. Sec to PM.”\n",
      "6 \n",
      " Mr. Parrikar’s noting reiterates all the facts noted by officials in the file, and reported by The Hindu, though he characterised part of the note as an “overreaction,” before asking the Defence Secretary to deal directly with the PMO, effectively delegating responsibility for resolving the issue to the Ministry’s top official.\n",
      "7 \n",
      " In Parliament, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman termed the questions regarding the PMO’s direct interference in the negotiations as “flogging a dead horse” and accused the Opposition of playing into the hands of multinational companies and vested interests. “They are flogging a dead horse. Periodical enquiries by the PMO cannot be construed as interference,” she told the Lok Sabha.\n",
      "8 \n",
      " She also rebuffed the Opposition charge and asserted that if the PMO’s monitoring of a deal was construed as interference, one needed to recall that as the then Chairperson of the National Advisory Council, Sonia Gandhi used to run the PMO regularly during the UPA regime. The Defence Minister contended that Mr. Parrikar had replied to the letter by asking the official to remain “calm” as everything was “allright.” “This selective kind of noting and building an issue falsely on it is completely called out today,” Ms. Sitharaman told reporters.\n",
      "9 \n",
      " “The response of the then Defence Minister was very clear… Under the direction of the same Defence Secretary, who was also the member of the negotiating committee, with his signature the file went to the Cabinet Committee on Security for approval,” she said. Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said then Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar had addressed the concerns raised by officials over the Rafale negotiations.\n",
      "10 \n",
      " “The response of the then Defence Minister was very clear… Under the direction of the same Defence Secretary, who was also the member of the negotiating committee, with his signature the file went to the Cabinet Committee on Security for approval,” she said. The Hindu’s report published an official communication in which MoD officials raise questions on how the PMO was holding “parallel negotiations” alongside the Indian Negotiating Team (INT). Mr. Parrikar’s noting in the letter was initially made public by the news agency ANI.\n",
      "11 \n",
      " Though Ms. Sitharaman quoted it to defend the government’s stand, it raises more questions both on the manner in which the Defence Secretary was asked to go easy, and whether the Defence Minister was entirely in the know about all aspects of the negotiations. Commenting on Mr. Parrikar’s role in the negotiations, former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah tweeted, “The then Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar was clueless about the progress of negotiations. All he could say was “IT APPEARS that PMO & French President’s office are monitoring the progress”. He had no direct knowledge of progress & passed the buck back to the PMO.”\n",
      "12 \n",
      " Following the revelations, the then Defence Secretary G. Mohan Kumar told ANI that the MoD letter had nothing to do with price. “It was about sovereign guarantees and general terms and conditions.” The government had repeatedly stated that the deal was between two sovereign governments and it was only recently revealed that the French government had given a ‘Letter of Comfort’ in lieu of sovereign guarantees.\n",
      "13 \n",
      " In a recent written reply in the Rajya Sabha, Ms. Sitharaman asserted that the ‘Letter of Comfort’ signed by the French Prime Minister and the IGA provide “adequate safeguards.” Also any dispute in the execution of the IGA would be settled through the Bilateral High Level Group established by the two governments, she added. “Any dispute not settled by this group shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law) arbitration rules,” Ms. Sitharaman wrote in the reply, indicating that despite the deal being negotiated through an IGA a dispute could be referred to a third party for resolution.\n",
      "14 \n",
      " Further, Mr. Parrikar’s comment that the PMO might be “monitoring the progress of issues” strengthens arguments that the interference may have adversely affected the INT’s leverage.\n",

      " Supreme Court has given a clean chit to the decision-making followed by the government for the Rafale jet deal between India and France\n",
      "16 \n",
      " Former French President Francois Hollande last week seemed to have given ammunition to the Congress to hit the ruling BJP over the controversial Rafale deal. Congress president Rahul Gandhi intensified his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. However, all the stakeholders involved in the deal have rebutted Rahul Gandhi's allegations.\n",
      "17 \n",
      " Francois Hollande, in an interview to Mediapart last week indicated that the partnership between Dassault Aviation, the makers of Rafale aircraft, and Reliance Defence was entered at the behest of the Indian government when he said, \"We did not have a choice, we took the interlocutor who was given to us.\"\n",
      "18 \n",
      " Soon after Francois Hollande's statement on September 21, Rahul Gandhi tweeted: \"The PM personally negotiated and changed the Rafale deal behind closed doors. Thanks to Francois Hollande, we now know he personally delivered a deal worth billions of dollars to a bankrupt Anil Ambani. The PM has betrayed India. He has dishonoured the blood of our soldiers.\"\n",
      "19 \n",
      " The next day, Rahul Gandhi, in another tweet, alleged that the PM and industrialist Anil Ambani jointly carried out a 130,000 crore surgical strike on the Indian defence forces. \"Modiji, you dishonoured the blood of our martyred soldiers. Shame on you. You betrayed India's soul,\" he added. However, very soon the tables seem to have turned for Rahul Gandhi.\n",
      "20 \n",
      " On September 22, former French President Francois Hollande in a statement to news agency AFP in Montreal, Canada contradicted his earlier remarks over the Rafale deal. Hollande said Reliance Defence and Dassault Aviation chose each other as offset partners in the Rafale deal and that there was no intervention of any government in choosing offset partner.\n",
      "21 \n",
      " This was the first rebuttal and this was followed by two others. In its statement, Dassault Aviation said, \"In accordance with the policy of Make in India, Dassault Aviation has decided to make a partnership with India's Reliance Group. This is Dassault's choice, as CEO Eric Trappier had explained in an interview published on April 17, 2018.\"\n",
      "22 \n",
      " The French government too issued a statement to refute Francois Hollande's earlier statement. It denied any involvement in the choice of Indian industrial partners. It said the French companies have selected or are selecting their Indian counterparts involved in the deal. \"French companies have the full freedom to choose the Indian partner companies that they consider to be the most relevant, and then present for the Indian government's approval the offsets projects that they wish to execute with their local partners,\" the French government said.\n",
      "23 \n",
      " The French government further said, \"The inter-governmental agreement signed on September 23, 2016 between the French and Indian governments for supply to India of 36 Rafale aircraft covers only the obligations of the French government to ensure the delivery and quality of the equipment.\" The Indian Ministry of Defence too dismissed the controversy as \"unnecessary\". It stuck to its stand that Dassault Aviation is yet to officially inform it of the different offsets partners in the Rs 59,000-crore contract for 36 Rafale aircraft.\n",
      "24 \n",
      " Though Rahul Gandhi sought to highlight Francois Hollande's previous statement that Reliance Defence was involved in the Rafale deal at the behest of the Indian government and that the French government did not have a choice, the former president's rebuttal has taken out the sting from the attack on the Modi government.\n",
      "25 \n",
      " The clarifications by Rafale makers Dassault and the French government too have neutralised Rahul Gandhi's attack for now.\n",
      "26 \n",
      " Stepping up attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday challenged the former to participate in a debate over the details of the Rafale fighter jets deal signed with the French government. Mr Gandhi claimed that the Prime Minister will not be in a position to answer his questions over the alleged scams in the deal.\n",
      "27 \n",
      " \"I challenge Modi Ji to come on stage anywhere, anytime and debate over Rafale with me for just 15 minutes. I will talk about Anil Ambani, HAL, French President's statements and the pricing of the jets. I will say that Defence Minister said clearly that it's Prime Minister who did it. The Prime Minister did not follow the procedure. The CBI Director was removed at 2 am. He will not be able to answer my questions,\" said Mr Gandhi.\n",
      "28 \n",
      " Reiterating his claim, the Congress chief said that Prime Minister Modi's demonetisation drive has benefited few of his \"businessmen friends\" in the country. Talking about the unemployment crisis in Chhattisgarh, Mr Gandhi said that the incumbent Chief Minister Raman Singh has failed to provide employment in the state despite ruling for 15 years.\n",
      "29 \n",
      " \"Raman Singh has been in power for the last 15 years and Prime Minister Modi has completed four and a half years in government at the Centre and both the governments have failed to fulfill their promise to generate employment opportunities for the youth,\" he said. Mr Gandhi added that once the Congress party comes to power in the state, government job vacancies will be filled. \"After Congress government comes to power, government job vacancies will be filled and it will also stop the practice of outsourcing of jobs, which is being done in BJP-ruled Chhattisgarh\", he added.\n",
      "30 \n",
      " He also promised that within 10 days after coming into power, the Congress party will waive off the loans of Chhattisgarh's farmers. \"Secondly, you all were told that you will get a bonus. For the last two years, you have not been getting the same. Not only we will resume this practice, but we will also compensate for the bonus of these two years, which BJP failed to do,\" said the Congress chief.\n",
      "31 \n",
      " The first phase of voting in Chhattisgarh was held on November 12, while the second phase is due on November 20. The counting of votes will be held on December 11. Disclaimer: NDTV has been sued for 10,000 crores by Anil Ambani's Reliance Group for its coverage of the Rafale deal.\n",
      "32 \n",
      " The government’s ‘financial availability’, according to the minister, dictated the decision to bring down the number of Rafale jets to be bought from 126 to the present 36 aircraft purchase deal, reports Tehelka Bureau Union minister Nitin Gadkari recently said that the government’s “financial availability” dictated the decision to bring down the number of Rafale jets to be bought from 126 to the present 36 aircraft purchase agreement. In an interview to journalist Karan Thapar, Gadkari admitted that financial considerations had been behind the scaling down of the order. “How can you advise me that you can take 100 planes? At least we need that much money to spend them, so it is depending upon the government’s financial position to purchase 36,” he said.\n",
      "33 \n",
      " On being further probed, he added, “Anything, anywhere you purchase, you take first phase, second phase, third phase and then you increase. Suppose, after 36 planes, if there is an availability of new technology, new plane with a cheaper price, then we are free to purchase that, why we should purchase from Rafale?”\n",
      "34 \n",
      " Gadkari also said that the attacks on late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi by Prime Minister Modi were a result of the Congress’ campaign, which had heaped abuses on the present PM. “Rahul Gandhi calls the PM a ‘chor’ (thief), this is a game of action and reaction… It is time for political parties to increase the standard of political campaign. I am expecting it from the Congress party,” he said.\n",
      "35 \n",
      " On May 10, the Centre had strongly defended before the Supreme Court its deal to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets from France, saying they were not for “ornamentation” but essential for national security. A bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi reserved verdict on the pleas, including the one filed by former Union ministers Yashwant Sinha, Arun Shourie and activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan, seeking review of its December 14 judgement which gave clean chit to the deal, media reports said.\n",
      "36 \n",
      " Attorney General K K Venugopal, appearing for the Centre, referred to the fact that Air Force in 2001-02 had raised the issue of acquiring 156 combat aircrafts. “The period from 2007 to 2015 was a great setback as combat aircraft are very essential for the country,” a PTI report quoted the top law officer as saying. “This is not for the purpose of the ornamentation. This is very essential for security”. Dealing with the scope of judicial review in cases relating to defence procurement, he said, “No court in the world will go into what is to be purchased in a defence deal”.\n",
      "37 \n",
      " Vehemently opposing the submissions of lawyer Prashant Bhushan, he sought dismissal of the review petitions saying that the basic grounds of these pleas were the same as in the main case. “The Supreme Court has already decided the challenge to the Rafale deal. I would still say that the petitioners are seeking review of the judgment on the basis of secret stolen documents,” he said.\n",
      "38 \n",
      " He then referred to a clause 10 of the IGA between France and India and said that it mandated maintaining the secrecy of the deal. “So far as the price is concerned, it is covered Article 10 of the inter-government agreement (IGA). Pricing under Article 10 was not supposed to be discussed in public domain”, he said.\n",
      "39 \n",
      " The Centre, however, shared the pricing details and the defence acquisition procedures with the court, he said. He also referred to the CAG report and said that it has been found that the government got the jets at 2.86 per cent lower price. The government is under obligation to put defence material under cover, he said, adding, “When the security of the country is involved, you do not view it as a contract to build a highway or a dam”.\n",
      "40 \n",
      " On the issue of registration of the FIR as mandated by the apex court judgement in the Lalita Kumari case, the law officer said, “There has to be a prima facie case, otherwise they (agencies) cannot proceed. The information must disclose commission of cognizable offence.” On the court’s question of waiver of sovereign guarantee in IGA and its replacement with a letter of comfort, Venugopal said it was not an “unprecedented practice” and referred to such agreements with Russia and US where there was waiver of sovereign guarantee. “It is a question of national security. No other court in the world will examine a \n",
      "41 \n",
      "  defence deal on these kinds of arguments”, he said. He said that the word ‘fraud’ is being bandied about and the entire docs in the Rafale case was never asked for by court. A mistake in interpretation cannot be the basis of review of an entire judgment. The government is under obligation to put defence material under cover, he said. The bench asked the Centre as to why there was no condition in the IGA that the jets would be made at HAL as mentioned in the earlier deal.\n",
      "42 \n",
      " Venugopal said that it could not materialise on grounds like more man power required by HAL in producing those jets here. “The lives of the pilots were at risk. The 126 MMRCA process was not working…so a conscious decision was taken by the head of the government to go ahead with the procurement of the 36 Rafale jets,” he reportedly said.\n",
      "43 \n",
      " On the issue of dissent note by the three members of the Indian Negotiating teal on the issue of pricing and alleged parallel negotiation by the PMO, he said later the three dissenting INT members agreed. The concerns raised by the three members were referred to Defence Acquisition Committee and said that these issues cannot be decided by the court.\n",
      "44 \n",
      " Lawyer Prashant Bhushan submitted that the judgement did not deal with the prayer seeking probe into the deal and decided the petition on the premise that it was seeking cancellation of IGA. He said that Centre misled the court by referring to non-existent CAG report in November, 2018 hearing when it is on record that the report came later in February this year.\n",
      "45 \n",
      " “How did the government anticipate even before the CAG report came that the pricing details of Rafale will be redacted. In a report submitted in November 2018, how did they know that the CAG report in February next year would redact pricing details,” the lawyer asked. Shourie also advanced arguments on his plea seeking perjury prosecution of some government officials for misleading the court during earlier hearing. The government alleged that the petitioners are seeking more documents to start a “fishing and roving enquiry”, he said adding that these papers are, in fact, in public domain.\n",
      "46 \n",
      " “Our intention is that the documents be seen by the court,” he said. “There is something called the Arms Trade Treaty of which France is a signatory and India is not because we found the treaty discriminatory. The treaty gives immunity to signatories, but a sovereign guarantee overrides this treaty and would protect India’s interests,” he said.\n",
      "47 \n",
      " The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government to provide within 10 days pricing details of the 36 Rafale fighter jets bought from France. The top court said it would “like to be apprised of the details with regard to pricing and cost particularly the advantages thereof, if any, which again will be submitted to the court in a sealed cover”.\n",
      "48 \n",
      " The government’s top law officer KK Venugopal, however, told the court that it would not be possible for the government to provide pricing details to the court since this information had not been provided to Parliament either. The Supreme Court, which is hearing petitions questioning the deal, told Attorney General KK Venugopal to make this point in their affidavit.\n",
      "49 \n",
      " At the last hearing, the court had ordered the government to provide details of the decision-making process. But the three-judge bench led by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi had then made it clear that it was only seeking this information “for the purpose of satisfying ourselves”. The bench had then, also underlined that the centre’s report did not have to cover pricing or suitability of the equipment for the Indian Air Force.\n",
      "50 \n",
      " The Supreme Court’s order on Wednesday, goes one step further. The three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, justice UU Lalit and justice K M Joseph said they had received the report about the process and wanted the government to share them with the petitioners too to the extent possible. “We are of the view that the information conveyed upon in the report, which can be legitimately be brought into the public domain be made available to the lead counsel of the petitioners in all cases. Along with the said facts, further details that could legitimately come in the public domain with respect to the induction of the Indian offset partner, if any, be also furnished to the lead counsel of the parties,” the bench ordered.\n",
      "51 \n",
      " It said that if there were any details that “may be considered to be strategic and confidential” may at this stage be placed before the court and may not be furnished to the petitioners. The NDA’s decision to enter an $8.7 billion government-to-government deal with France to buy the 36 Rafale warplanes made by Dassault was announced in April 2015, with an agreement signed a little over a year later. This replaced the previous United Progressive Alliance regime’s decision to buy 126 Rafale aircraft, 108 of which were to be made in India by the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.\n",
      "52 \n",
      " The petitions have been filed by lawyers Vineet Dhanda and ML Sharma. Aam Aadmi Party’s Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh has also moved the top court against the Rafale deal; Sanjay Singh has sought a court order for the formation of a special team to probe the matter under the Supreme Court’s oversight.\n",

      "61 \n",
      " Party spokesperson Manish Tewari said the Congress will press for her resignation in case she fails to substantiate her claim in Parliament that HAL was given contracts worth Rs one lakh crore. Tewari alleged that the problem with the BJP-led NDA government is that whenever they are confronted with facts, they try and resort to hair splitting. “Chicanery rather than an assertion of the truth has been the syna qua non of this government,” he said during a press briefing\n",
      "62 \n",
      " The Congress leader said it is a strange situation and wondered why the HAL is borrowing to pay salaries, if it has funds. “The Congress will demand answers from the government in Parliament and if a reply does not come, it will take appropriate steps. If the defence minister does not provide documents and evidence of the claims made by her, then the Congress party will demand the resignation of the defence minister,” he said.\n",

      " The Congress has been targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Rafale deal, alleging that the price of each aircraft was sharply hiked from around Rs 526 crore, negotiated under the deal during UPA, to Rs 1,600 crore and that the contract will help Anil Ambani get a Rs 30,000 crore benefit through offset contract.\n",
      "64 \n",
      " Sitharaman says Rafale will bring Modi back to power On Friday, Sitharaman accused the Congress of misleading the country with \"falsehood\" on Rafale deal and said while the Bofors scam brought the Congress down, Rafale will bring Prime Minister Narendra Modi back into power. Countering the Congress' charge, she said that it was the Indian Air Force which suggested that the government buy two squadrons or 36 Rafale jets in fly-away condition instead of 18, as was planned to be purchased under the Congress-led UPA government.\n",
      "65 \n",
      " She accused the Congress of compromising with national security in the interest of the party's \"treasury\" while deciding on buying 126 fighter jets. With regard to pricing difference, Sitharaman said there was no formal price noting by the Congress of Rs 526 crore as the deal price. But the price negotiated by the NDA government is nine percent lower than what was negotiated by UPA.\n",
      "66 \n",
      " \"Comparing the cost of Rs 526 crore with Rs 1,600 crore, is like comparing apples to oranges. The cost quoted in 2007, will it remain the same in 2016, because there is escalation cost and there is exchange rate variation,\" she said. \"The price of the basic aircraft cannot be compared with price of weaponised aircraft,\" the minister further said.\n",

      " The French authorities waived taxes amounting to over Rs 1,000 crore (Euro 143.7 million) for a French-registered company of the group within six months of the announcement by India to buy 36 Rafale jets in 2015, French newspaper Le Monde said. It claimed that “between February and October 2015, while the French were negotiating the Rafale contract with India, got a of Euro 143.7 million from the French state”.\n",

      " When contacted, a spokesperson denied any favouritism by and said Reliance FLAG Atlantic SAS, a subsidiary, owned a terrestrial cable network and other telecom infrastructure in “During the period under consideration by the French tax authorities — 2008-2012 — i.e. nearly 10 years ago, Flag France had an operating loss of Rs 20 crore (Euro 2.7 million). The French tax authorities had raised a tax demand of over Rs 1,100 crore for the same period. According to the French tax settlement process and as per law, a mutual settlement agreement was signed to pay Rs 56 crore as a final settlement,” the spokesperson said, adding that the tax demand was completely illegal.\n",
      "69 \n",
      " The company said the settlement was done much before the Indian government decided to purchase Rafale jets. In a statement, the Indian defence ministry said: “Any connections drawn between the tax issue and the is totally inaccurate, tendentious, and a mischievous attempt to disinform.” Neither the period of the tax concession nor the subject matter of the concession relates even remotely to the concluded during the tenure of the present government, it said.\n",
      "70 \n",
      " Reacting to the controversy, the French government said a global settlement was reached between the French tax authorities and Reliance FLAG, in a tax dispute pertaining to the period 2008-2012. “This settlement was conducted in full adherence with the legislative and regulatory framework governing this common practice of the tax administration. It was not subject to any political interference,” French Ambassador to India Alexandre Zeigler tweeted.\n",

      " The Le Monde report revealed that Anil Ambani’s French telecom company was under scrutiny. “The company was investigated by the French tax authorities and was found liable to pay Euro 60 million in taxes for the period 2007 to 2010. Reliance offered to pay Euro 7.6 million as a settlement. The French tax authorities refused. They conducted another investigation for the period 2010 to 2012 and asked for an additional Euro 91 million in taxes,” tweeted Julien Bouissou, the South Asia correspondent for Le Monde, who wrote the story with Anne Michel. By the time Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the plans to buy Rafale fighter jets from Dassault in April 2015, the Anil Ambani-firm had owed about Euro 151 million to the French government. However, six months after Modi’s Rafale announcement, in October 2015, the French tax authorities accepted only Euro 7.3 million from Reliance as a settlement, instead of the much bigger sum of Euro 151 million, Le Monde reported.\n",

      " Sitharaman on Sunday evening released some papers to show that HAL has signed contracts of Rs 26,570 crore and was set to get more orders of Rs 73,000 crore in future. This comes after she was accused of lying by Rahul Gandhi. Gandhi had tweeted, \"When you tell one lie, you need to keep spinning out more lies, to cover up the first one.

The government has ten days to do so. \"The court would also like to be apprised of the details with regard to the pricing/cost, particularly the advantage thereof, [if] any,\" said a bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi in its order.\n",
      "78 \n",
      " Changing its stand after the Centre filed a \"confidential note\" regarding the Rafale procurement process, the bench also directed the government to give details on the \"core information\" regarding the procurement process to the petitioners. The details regarding the selection of the Indian offset partner -- Reliance Defence -- will also have to be shared with the petitioners.\n",
      "79 \n",
      " The government has so far maintained that the details of the defence deal are \"confidential.\" Earlier this year, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that the cost per plane of the Rafale jets could not be shared with Parliament due to a secrecy clause. During the hearing, Attorney General KK Venugopal told the court that even the Parliament has not been given the details of the Rafale deal. \"Some of these details may be subject to the Official Secrets Act or confidentiality clauses,\" he argued.\n",
      "80 \n",
      " Taking note of the objection raised by the Attorney General, the bench said that \"details that could legitimately come in [the] public domain\" will have to be shared with the petitioners, while the \"confidential information\" regarding the pricing and the selection of the Indian offset partner will have to be \"placed before the court,\" in a sealed cover.\n",
      "81 \n",
      " The court has left it to the government to decide what would be the information \"legitimately in public domain\" which can be shared with the petitioners, but has made it clear that all information will have to be shared with the court. \"If you think that anything comes under the Official Secrets Act or is confidential, you say it on affidavit,\" the court said.\n",

      " All these reports will have to be submitted within 10 days. The Supreme Court will now hear the petitions on November 14. Four separate PILs have been filed before the Supreme Court regarding the Rafale deal. All the pleas have sought a court-monitored investigation into the alleged \"corruption\" in the deal.\n",
      "83 \n",
      " The pleas had also raised several questions regarding allegations that defence procurement norms were not followed by the Indian government in inking the deal with its French counterparts. The cost of the deal has also been questioned by the petitions. Interestingly, the Supreme Court has declined to hear arguments from the petitioners for now, observing that the petitions have not raised any questions about the technical specifications of the aircraft, or the suitability of the fighter jets for the Indian Air force. \"What has been questioned is the decision-making process and the price or cost of the equipment,\" the bench noted.\n",
      "84 \n",
      " On October 10, when the matter was heard by the Supreme Court for the first time, the court had held that it would not go into the issue of pricing of the aircraft. The change in the court's order on Wednesday was welcomed by former minister and petitioner Arun Shourie. \"The court has expanded the scope. Without issuing notice to the government directly, they have called for all information. Now we will see what the details of the deal are,\" Shourie told India Today.\n",
      "85 \n",
      " The deal in a nutshell: In 2016, India and France signed a deal for 36 Rafale jets, to be delivered to India starting this September. A previous UPA-era deal never went through. Under the final contract, Dassault Aviation, which makes Rafales, needed to make compensation investments (or offsets) in India worth 50 per cent of the value of the purchase. In October 2016, Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence Limited and Dassault announced a joint venture. (Read a timeline of the deal till September 2018 here.)\n",
      "86 \n",
      " ALSO READ | Dassault's chief executive said Rafales will be delivered to India starting next year. Differences in the UPA and NDA deals: The first deal was for 126 jets: Eighteen to be imported in a fly-away condition, and 108 to be manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited with help from Dassault. The current deal is for 36 aircraft. As well, the Congress claims its deal was cheaper. (Go deeper.)\n",
      "87 \n",
      " Why the deal is controversial The Congress has alleged that the Modi government favoured Anil Ambani's Reliance to HAL's detriment. The row took on an explosive new dimension when Francois Hollande, the man who was France's president when the 2016 deal was inked, said the Indian government \"proposed\" Reliance Defence as Dassault's Indian partner (for the offset clause of the agreement).\n",
      "88 \n",
      " The Congress on Friday accused the government of trying to hide its \"theft\" in the Rafale deal behind a court ruling that did not wish to intervene in a defence deal and persisted with its demand for a JPC inquiry into the purchase of fighter jets from France. Talking to the media here, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, said that the government wanted to speak on the judgment when the House was not in order.\n",
      "89 \n",
      " \"They are trying to hide the theft under the guise\" of PIL-triggered court judgement, he said. The Congress was not allowed to seek clarifications after Home Minister Rajnath Singh made a statement in the Lok Sahha, he said. \"Our demand continues to be JPC (Joint Parliamentary Committee). They want to hide behind the judgement… We will not tolerate this, nor will the people of the country.\"\n",
      "90 \n",
      " Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala also told reporters that there was corruption in the deal. \"There is multi-layered corruption in the deal. We know that the Supreme Court has no powers to look into all the aspects. So the Congress never went to the Supreme Court,\" he said. \"I challenge (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi (to go) for a JPC probe. If you are not scared, why should there not be a JPC? The government will have to tell why price of aircraft — the rate per aircraft has gone up from Rs 526 crore to Rs 1,670 crore,\" he said.\n",
      "91 \n",
      " Surjewala said \"half-baked\" information about the deal was given by the government to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed four petitions seeking court-monitored probe into the purchase of 36 Rafale jet fighters in ready-to-fly conditions holding that the decision making process was not in doubt and it cannot go into the question of pricing and choice of offset Indian partner by the French aircraft manufacturer Dassault.\n",
      "92 \n",
      " As election season draws nearer and political parties begin campaigning across the country, allegations and counter-allegations have been flying thick and fast between leaders. For the Congress, its latest weapons to attack the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are the corruption claims against the Narendra Modi government in the Rafale deal. While the Congress has been consistently calling out the NDA government over its \"shoddy\" handling of the Rs 58,000-crore fighter jet deal since 2015, it is former French president François Hollande's recent statement over the issue that seems to have given more credibility to the party's claims. The party is hoping to translate this into electoral victory in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Mizoram, Manipur, Madhya Pradesh and in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls as well.\n",
      "93 \n",
      " In the latest development in the Rafale controversy, ex-French president François Hollande's issued a statement indicating that the Indian government in 2015 pushed Dassault Aviation to partner with the Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Defence, and said the French government had no say in that regard. Since 2014, the Congress has been losing its foothold across the country, facing successive defeats in Assembly elections in states such as Uttar Pradesh, Meghalaya etc. Even in Karnataka this year, the party managed to grab a slice of the power pie by stitching a last minute alliance with rival JD(S) and ensuring the party remained in power. With party president Rahul Gandhi attempting to create a united Opposition ahead of the 2019 General Election, the aim is to block the BJP's rise, in any way possible.\n",
      "94 \n",
      " Among a host of other issues, the Rafale deal controversy is one of the best weapons the party has at the moment. While the BJP has faced severe criticism over their intolerance of minorities and statements over love jihad, gau raksha, Hindu rashtra etc, both Modi and his Cabinet of Ministers have successfully kept themselves away from direct involvement in corruption scandals.\n",
      "95 \n",
      " As much as the BJP is trying to reject allegations of corruption in the Rafale deal, the Congress party is not going to let go of Hollande's statement any time soon. Mediapart, a French language publication, quoted Hollande as saying, \"It was the Indian government that proposed this service group (Reliance Defence), and Dassault who negotiated with Ambani. We had no choice, we took the interlocutor who was given to us.\" Asked who selected Reliance as a partner and why, Hollande replied, \"We had no say in this regard.\"\n",
      "96 \n",
      " What is the Rafale deal and why is it important to Congress? Rafale is a French twin-engine multi-role fighter jet designed and built by Dassault Aviation. They are considered one of the most potent combat jets globally. The Indian Air Force (IAF), which requires a minimum of 42 fighter squadrons to achieve optimal capability, declined down to 34 squadrons between 2000-2012 due to obsolescence. The original proposal to buy 126 fighter aircraft was first mooted during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee's NDA government.\n",
      "97 \n",
      " However, it was under then-prime minister Manmohan Singh in 2007, that India began the process to buy a fleet of 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) after the defence ministry, headed then by Congress leader AK Antony, cleared the proposal from the Indian Air Force. The contenders for the mega deal were Lockheed Martin’s F-16s, Eurofighter Typhoon, Russia’s MiG-35, Sweden’s Gripen, Boeing’s F/A-18s and Dassault Aviation’s Rafale. After a long-drawn process, bids were opened in December 2012 and Dassault Aviation emerged as L-1 (lowest bidder).\n",
      "98 \n",
      " In the original proposal, 18 planes were to be manufactured in France and 108 in India in collaboration with the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. Discussions between Dassault and the UPA began in early 2012 for 126 Rafales. The final negotiations continued till early 2014 but the deal could not go through.\n",
      "99 \n",
      " After Modi became the prime minister in 2014, he visited France a year later and announced that India will purchase 36 ready-to-fly Rafale jets in a government-to-government agreement, instead of assembling a majority of the aircraft in India. A joint statement issued on 10 April, 2015, after talks between Modi and then French president François Hollande, said they agreed to conclude an Inter-Governmental Agreement for supply of 36 Rafale jets on terms that would be better than conveyed by Dassault Aviation as part of a separate process underway.\n",
      "100 \n",
      " This irked Congress as there were lengthy negotiations between the then-UPA government and Dassault on prices and transfer of technology. After Modi's announcement, questions were raised by the Opposition on how the prime minister finalised the deal without approval of the Cabinet Committee on Security. The Congress also accused the Centre of massive irregularities in the deal, alleging that the government was procuring each aircraft at a cost of over Rs 1,670 crore as against Rs 526 crore finalised by the UPA government. The party has also demanded answers from the government on why state-run aerospace major HAL was not involved in the deal. The Congress has also sought to know price details of the aircraft and how the rate per aircraft has gone up from Rs 526 crore to Rs 1,670 crore. The government has refused to share the details, citing a secrecy clause of a 2008 pact between India and France.\n",
      "101 \n",
      " Furthermore, the Congress alleged the NDA government was benefitting the Reliance Defence Limited (RDL) through the Rafale deal as the company has set up a joint venture with Dassault Aviation to execute the offset obligation for the Rs 59,000 crore deal. The party alleged that Reliance Defence was formed just 12 days before the announcement of the Rafale deal by the prime minister on 10 April, 2015. However, RDL has rejected all the charges.\n",
      "102 \n",
      " India and France signed an €7.87 billion (Rs 59,000 crore approximately) deal on 23 September, 2016 for 36 Rafale jets. The delivery of the aircraft will begin from September 2019. On 3 October, 2016, RDL and Dassault Aviation announced a joint venture in the aerospace sector and a year later, foundation stone of a manufacturing facility was laid in Mihan, Nagpur.\n",
      "103 \n",
      " War of words over Rafale controversy in recent past Over the last three years, the Congress has been actively castigating the Modi government and accusing them of corruption, and trying to further the \"interests\" of a few businessmen. Taking a dig at Reliance Defence and Modi, Gandhi tweeted on 16 November, 2017.\n",
      "104 \n",
      " In February this year, when an Urdu daily reported that Gandhi, who met Muslim intellectuals, told them that the Congress was a party of Muslims, the BJP was quick to call the party trying to create a \"partition-like situation\" in the country. In response, the Congress accused BJP of \"creating controversies\" to avoid talking about \"real issues\".\n",
      "105 \n",
      " \"I request Nirmala Sitharamanji that you have not bothered to answer the nation about the Rs 58,000 crore Rafale deal which is the biggest scam. If you have the courage, in this Monsoon Session, please make a suo moto statement and reply to the nation about how the defence ministry has conducted the biggest scam under your nose,\" Congress spokesperson Sushmita Dev had said.\n",
      "106 \n",
      " Gandhi said he had asked the French president Emmanuel Macron about the Indian government's claim that it cannot share the price details due to a secrecy pact between India and France. The French leader told him that there was no such pact, he claimed. After his statement, France said a security agreement it concluded with India in 2008 legally binds the two countries to protect the classified information relating to operational capabilities of defence equipment. However, it did not specifically mention whether the classified information included details of the pricing, over which the Congress has made allegations.\n",
      "107 \n",
      " A day later, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley hit back at Gandhi's remarks on the Rafale deal and wrote the party manufactured fake row over Rafale deal to overcome limitations of its leadership. \"It has manufactured the issue of the Rafale deal. The issue is failing to cut much ice. It's a government-to-government agreement with no private group involved. It involves national security and it is the armed forces which have preferred this aircraft for its improved combat ability,\" he wrote.\n",
      "108 \n",
      " The Congress also moved a privilege motion against Modi and Sitharaman for \"misleading\" Parliament. On 27 July, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala called the multi-crore Rafale jet deal \"the biggest example of crony capitalism\" and alleged the Modi government \"compromised national interest\" by helping a private entity to the tune of crores of rupees in violation of rules.\n",
      "109 \n",
      " Parliamentary proceedings were often disrupted in the Lok Sabha over demands to probe the Rafale deal, forcing multiple adjournments of the House. In August, Opposition parties in Lok Sabha clamoured for a probe into the row, with the Congress demanding the setting up of a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to investigate it. The demand for a JPC was raised in the Lok Sabha by Congress MP KC Venugopal when he initiated the debate on the Supplementary Demand for Grants for 2018-19 and the demand for excess grants for 2015-16.\n",
      "110 \n",
      " He said the House should know about the cost of the Rafale deal and alleged that there was \"a major scam\". Objecting to his demand, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey urged Deputy Speaker M Thambi Durai that Venugopal should place the evidence before the House before making any \"wild allegation\". Later, Trinamool Congress leader Saugata Roy also said that the Rafale deal was \"one of the biggest scandals of independent India\". \"The country is going to lose Rs 2,500 crore due to Rafale deal,\" Roy said, while demanding a \"full-fledged enquiry\" into the fighter jet deal.\n",
      "111 \n",
      " The Congress also dubbed the Rafale controversy as \"Modi's Bofors\" and alleged that the prime minister \"dumped\" Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and inducted Reliance Defence Limited as Dassault's offset partner. The Bofors scam in the 1980s had tainted the image of the Rajiv Gandhi regime. More recently, Gandhi also attacked the Modi government over the defence deal while launching upcoming state and 2019 Lok Sabha polls. In Chhattisgarh in August, the Congress chief claimed that the price of the Rafale jets \"magically\" rose from Rs 540 to Rs 1,600 crore per piece. \"The UPA government had readied the Rafale contract, according to which the price for each jet was approximately Rs 540 crore. The contract was ready and Modi only had to take a decision,\" he said.\n",
      "112 \n",
      " \"But, Modi goes to France and scraps the previous contract and the defence minister and other cabinet ministers do not know about it,\" Gandhi had said. He spoke along similar lines in Karnataka and Rajasthan as well. To counter Gandhi's remarks, the BJP said the issue was thoroughly discussed in Parliament and no irregularities were found. \"\"All wrong deeds happened during the Congress rule. Both UPA-1 and UPA-2 dispensation are known for corruption. They do not want to eliminate corruption,\" Rajasthan BJP president Madan Lal Saini said in August.\n",
      "113 \n",
      " To mock Congress, the BJP also released a video titled \"Rafale deal for dummies\", featuring television personality Pallavi Joshi, who attempts to explain the agreement by making comparisons with the workings of a housing society. There were several such \"Twitter wars\" between the BJP and the Opposition where the former accused Gandhi of not knowing the exact cost of the Rafale jets during the UPA regime.\n",
      "114 \n",
      " Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday made an explosive claim in Parliament claiming that French President Emmanuel Macron had told him there was no 'secrecy' clause in the Rafale deal preventing India from revealing details of the cost per aircraft. Here is what the French president had to say when he was interviewed by India Today Group Editorial Director Raj Chengappa: \"In India and in France, when the deal is very sensitive, we can't reveal details because of business reasons. Part of the absence of answers to some technical issues is these commercial agreements and the interests of different companies.\"\n",
      "115 \n",

      " Three senior Defence Ministry officials who were the domain experts on the seven-member Indian Negotiating Team (INT) came to a well-substantiated and clear conclusion that the Narendra Modi government’s new Rafale deal for 36 flyaway aircraft was not on “better terms” than the offer made by Dassault Aviation during the procurement process for 126 aircraft under the United Progressive Alliance government. They also concluded that the delivery schedule of even the first 18 of the 36 flyaway Rafale aircraft in the new deal was slower than the one offered for the 18 flyaway aircraft in the original procurement process.\n",
      "117 \n",
      " These findings are directly contrary to the two central claims made by the Indian government of a cheaper deal and faster delivery of fighter aircraft, claims that have been affirmed before the Supreme Court of India in official submissions. Further, the three officials registered serious concern over the Indian government’s acceptance of a ‘Letter of Comfort’ in lieu of a sovereign or government guarantee or bank guarantees, legal issues relating to the IGA, offset issues, and Dassault Aviation’s restrictive trade practices.\n",
      "118 \n",
      " The three domain experts on the INT were M. P. Singh, Adviser (Cost), a Joint Secretary-level officer from the Indian Cost Accounts Service; A.R. Sule, Financial Manager (Air); and Rajeev Verma, Joint Secretary & Acquisitions Manager (Air). They recorded their views in a strong note of dissent, dated June 1, 2016, submitted at the end of the negotiations to the Deputy Chief of Air Staff (DCAS) in his capacity as chairman of the negotiating team.\n",
      "119 \n",
      " Click here to see all eight pages of the note of dissent by domain experts in the INT The INT was for a firm and fixed benchmark price, but the French side converted the initial commerical offer of a fixed price into one based on an escalation formula. Their eight-page note expressing deep concern and unease over the terms of the new deal is an important document and is reproduced here. It was written more than a month after the INT’s negotiations with the French side were completed and three months before the inter-governmental agreement was signed, on September 23, 2016. (As for the competence of the three officials in relation to the others on the INT to deal with the issues that figured in the negotiations, see this article in ‘The Wire’ by Sudhansu Mohanty, former Controller General of Defence Accounts who was Financial Adviser, Defence Services at the time)\n",
      "120 \n",
      " Commenting on the final €7.87 billion cost of the new Rafale deal, the domain experts stated that “the reasonability of price offered by the French Government is not established. Even the final price offered by the French Government cannot be considered as ‘better terms’ compared to the MMRCA [medium multi-role combat aircraft] offer and therefore not meeting the requirement of the Joint Statement.”\n",

It promised that the new deal to acquire 36 Rafale jets in flyaway condition through an inter-governmental agreement would be on “terms that would be better than conveyed by Dassault Aviation as part of a separate process under way” and that the delivery would be in “a time frame that would be compatible with the operational requirement of the IAF.”\n",
      "122 \n",
      " The joint statement also confirmed that the aircraft and associated systems would be delivered in “the same configuration as had been tested and approved by IAF, and with a longer maintenance responsibility by France.” The concerns and differences registered by the three senior Defence Ministry officials in the seven-member negotiating team bring under a cloud the two major defences of the new Rafale deal by the National Democratic Alliance government, namely, that this deal was on better terms and with a faster delivery schedule than the deal under negotiation under the UPA government and also under the NDA government until April 10, 2016. These were also the essential arguments presented by the government in the Supreme Court of India. Whether this note by the three domain experts on the INT was part of the material submitted in a sealed cover to the court is not known, but it could be of relevance to the review petition on the judgment which is pending in the court.\n",
      "123 \n",
      " The government informed the Supreme Court of India in documents submitted in October 2018 that Mr. Modi made the announcement on the new deal in Paris because of an urgent need to arrest the decline in the number of fighter squadrons with the IAF. However, the three Defence Ministry officials had noted that “in the MMRCA process, the first 18 flyaway aircraft were delivered between T0+36 months to T0+48 months whereas in the delivery schedule offered by the French side, the first 18 aircraft will be delivered between T0+36 months and T0+53 months.” Significantly, the Rafale aircraft delivered to the Indian Air Force will not have full operational capability: the 13 India Specific Enhancements (ISE) will be fitted in India “in batches after April 2022, when the 36th Rafale is delivered, 67 months after the signing of the IGA (see report by Dinakar Peri in The Hindu).\n",
      "124 \n",
      " One of the most contentious issues about the Rafale deal, which went up for resolution to the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) chaired by the Prime Minister, was the benchmark price. This is a number discovered in advance by financial experts which acts as a ceiling on the finally negotiated price of the whole package. The three officials pointed out in their note that the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) stipulated that in all cases the Contract Negotiating Committee “should establish a benchmark and reasonableness of price in an Internal Meeting before opening the Commercial Offer.” In this case, the Defence Acquisition Council had directed on August 28 and September 1, 2015 that the benchmark price should be decided and finalised by the INT before starting price negotiations. Following a detailed technical process, which factored in the necessary equalisations and adjustments, the benchmark price determined for the aircraft and weapons packages in the new deal was €5.06 billion.\n",
      "125 \n",
      " Here the note from the three domain experts provides crucial and hitherto unpublished information on how the final price for the whole Rafale package shot up to €7.87 billion: “It is highlighted that the initial commercial offer from the French side was for firm and fixed price which was converted to price based on escalation formula during the price negotiations. The benchmark price prepared by INT was for firm and fixed price and not adjusted to price based on escalation formula. The final price offered by the French Government (which is escalation based) is 55.6% above the benchmark (which is for firm and fixed price). Considering the future escalations till the time of delivery, the gap in the benchmark and the final price would further increase. Minor adjustments towards costs of Technical Publications, Advance Training of IAF Pilots and Technicians and Role Equipment would not make much dent to this huge gap.”\n",
      "126 \n",
      " The offer which also figured in the determination of the benchmark price was from M/s EADS, the maker of the Eurofighter Typhoon, the only other aircraft to qualify the UPA-era trials along with Rafale. “During the benchmarking exercise,” the note reveals, “the INT had noted that the offer of 20% discount by M/s EADS was absolute without any escalation factor except some modifications in the payment terms.” Factoring in an additional 5% discount as the negotiating margin, the Indian Negotiating Team applied a discount of 25% on the M/s EADS cost as one of the inputs for the benchmarking exercise.\n",
      "127 \n",
      " “Even without taking this discount into consideration, the offer of French Government is still substantially higher than the price offered by M/s EADS (adjusted to the scope of 36 Rafale Aircraft Procurement) when compared on firm and fixed price as per broad assessment carried out with the MMRCA Cell.” Contrary to the argument put forth by the government that the UPA-era commercial offer and the deal signed by Modi government are not comparable, the note states that in the DAC on May 13, 2015, where the case for the 36 Rafale flyaway aircraft was first approved, G. Mohan Kumar, the Defence Secretary, “suggested that the ‘Benchmark Price’ and comparison of how much lesser it was, vis-à-vis the earlier Price (since this was a commitment to the PM by the French Government) should be arrived at and placed on record before proceeding any further.”\n",
      "128 \n",
      " “To establish ‘better terms for price’,” the note goes on to narrate, “the French side was repeatedly asked to align the commercial offers submitted by Industrial Suppliers in MMRCA process to the scope of supplies as per 36 Rafale procurement.” However, “the French side refused to take cognizance of this aspect.”\n",
      "129 \n",
      " “The commercial offers in the MMRCA process were aligned by the INT after factoring in the scope of supplies as per 36 Rafale procurement and compared with the final offer made by the French side,” the note adds. While the commercial offers submitted by Dassault Aviation during the UPA government were based on the submission of bank guarantees against advance payments, the final price offered to Modi government was without any sovereign or government guarantee or bank guarantees.\n",
      "130 \n",
      " The aligned cost, which included the bank guarantee cost, was €8.059 billion, which came down to €7.48 billion after the commercial impact of bank guarantees of 7.28% was deducted. The final price offered by the French to the Modi government was “still 5.3% higher than the Aligned Cost of the commercial quotes submitted by M/s Dassault Aviation and M/s MBDA in MMRCA procurement process.”\n",
      "131 \n",
      " The other claim made by the NDA government is that it has negotiated for the Indian Air Force a better delivery schedule than what was under prolonged process during the UPA government. The note says that “as per the DAC meeting held on 28-08-2015 and 01-09-2015 the delivery schedule incorporated in draft IGA is T0+37 months to T0+60 months,” but “the delivery schedule finally offered by the French side is T0+36 months to T0+67 months.”\n",
      "132 \n",
      " But the clinching evidence for the three officials is the delivery schedule of the 18 flyaway aircraft in the UPA-government contract. Their note says that “in the MMRCA process, the first 18 flyaway aircrafts were being delivered between T0+36 months to T0+48 months whereas in the delivery schedule offered by the French side, first 18 aircrafts will be delivered between T0+36 months and T0+53 months.”\n",
      "133 \n",
      " As reported in The Hindu of January 18, 2019, the big difference in the per-aircraft price between the two deals – one being negotiated under the original MMRCA procurement process, the other concluded by the NDA government – was the distribution of the exorbitant cost for the “design and development” of 13 India Specific Enhancements over 36 instead of 126 aircraft. More details have emerged in this note which, while validating The Hindu’s investigative findings on this issue, provide greater clarity on what this “design and development” cost of the ISEs was all about.\n",
      "134 \n",
      " “During the MMRCA procurement process,” the note of dissent reveals, “the aircraft offered by M/s Dassault Aviation did not meet certain ASQRs [Aerospace Supplier Quality Requirement] stipulated in the MMRCA RFP. M/s Dassault Aviation offered to meet these deficiencies at an additional cost. M/s Dassault Aviation termed these deficiencies as India Specific Enhancements (ISEs) for which an Additional Commercial Proposal was accepted from M/s Dassault Aviation in the MMRCA procurement process with the approval of the DAC.”\n",
      "135 \n",
      " However, the note clarifies that “the MMRCA offer of M/s Dassault Aviation, including the Additional Commercial Proposal, was an un-negotiated offer and reasonability of all elements of cost was yet to be established.” The note goes on to say that “it was particularly noted by the INT that the Additional Commercial Proposal of 1400 million Euros towards NRC for Design and Development of ISE was exorbitant and unrealistic. The price has been further escalated in the final offer and then reduced factoring in global discounts given by the French side and also the financial impact due to alignment of advance/stage payments schedule with the MMRCA offer.”\n",
      "136 \n",
      " A comparison with the mid-life upgrade of Mirage-2000, supplied by Dassault Aviation, was highlighted by the three members: “The Mirage MLU Contract of July 2011 wherein price for D&D was only 348 million Euros; therefore, the price quoted for ISE in the final offer is exorbitantly high.” The report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India on the deal is long overdue. The institution is constitutionally empowered and proudly terms itself the ‘Supreme Audit Institution of India’ at its website. Whether the rich information in this note of dissent by the three domain experts on the INT, and other documents that have come to light through independent journalistic investigation, will find its way into the CAG report and the conclusions drawn will be widely followed across the media and political spectrum.\n",
      "137 \n",
      " CEO Rajesh Dhingra says Dassault chose Reliance Defence to meet its 'offset', or export obligation, in the Rafale deal and that the defence ministry has no role in the selection of Indian partners by foreign vendors\n",
      "138 \n",
      " In politics, timing is everything. For instance, the wily Mulayam Singh Yadav set the cat among the pigeons at the end of his speech in the Lok Sabha on the last day of the Budget Session. His endorsement of Narendra Modi came even as his son was protesting against the BJP and schmoozing with other mahagathbandhan partners. The media went into a tizzy. His one comment, made at an opportune time, has the potential to upset all calculations on the chessboard of Uttar Pradesh politics.\n",
      "139 \n",
      " Congress chief Rahul Gandhi should learn a thing or two about timing from Mulayam, an old warhorse who single-handedly changed Uttar Pradesh's political equation and reinforced the importance of regional players in national politics by building a party from scratch, making it a dominant force in India's largest state. The Congress president has launched a high-octane campaign on an alleged scam in the procurement of Rafale fighter jets from France and has not ignored any opportunity to criticise the prime minister. He has held Narendra Modi personally responsible for the so-called scam, called the prime minister a spy, schizophrenic and \"middleman\" for a \"crony capitalist friend\" and declared him guilty of treason against the State for \"violating Official Secrets Act\". These rabble-rousing statements make for good campaign rhetoric, but carry no weight without proof for backing, or even a smoking gun. These are blank fires.\n",
      "140 \n",
      " And yet Rahul's strategy wasn't wrong. Defence deals in India have always been opaque and have historically been associated with corruption. If there indeed were irregularities — financial or procedural — in the procurement of the Rafale jets and the NDA government's claims do not tally with facts, as the de facto 'Leader of Opposition', Rahul has every right to highlight them. To hit the government where it hurts, all that the Congress chief needed was to anchor his charges on a smattering of facts. And he would have got a golden opportunity on Wednesday, when the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) on defence acquisitions for the Indian Air Force, including the Rafale deal, was tabled in Parliament.\n",
      "141 \n",
      " The much-awaited report had the exact price points redacted and gave the Modi government a slight advantage over the UPA-brokered deal in terms of savings, but it still gives the Opposition enough ammo with which to target the government. The CAG's forensic audit of the Rafale deal finds that the NDA government's €7.87-billion contract to procure 36 fighter jets in \"flyaway\" condition from Dassault Aviation is 2.86 percent cheaper than the deal negotiated by the UPA in 2007.\n",
      "142 \n",
      " Although this tallies with the Modi government's claims that it had brokered a \"better deal\" in terms of pricing, it demolishes the NDA's previous claims of a 20 percent, or even a 9 percent, advantage over the UPA deal. Union minister Arun Jaitley has claimed \"vindication\", perhaps because the report debunks Congress' outlandish claims over the pricing of the jets — the UPA's deal was 55 percent cheaper, for example — but Jaitley would know that the CAG report points out several issues with NDA's deal that could make the government sweat.\n",
      "143 \n",
      " The biggest among these is the lack of a sovereign guarantee or a bank guarantee in the NDA-brokered deal with France. Instead, the Modi government settled for a Letter of Comfort from the French government. However, a Letter of Comfort provides the original equipment manufacturer — Dassault, in this case — with a lot of legal options, even if it fails to comply with the agreement.\n",
      "144 \n",
      " \"In case of an IGA (intergovernmental agreement) for 36 Rafale, the offer of M/s DA (Dassault Aviation) in 2007 had included a 15 percent bank guarantee against advance payments, 5 percent each for performance guarantee and warranty. A bank guarantee gets directly and automatically invoked in case of a breach of contract by the seller. In the 2015 offer, the French vendor did not furnish any financial and performance bank guarantees,\" the CAG report says.\n",
      "145 \n",
      " These are legitimate red flags, and the government would be hard-pressed to explain why it did not push for a bank guarantee. The CAG also notes that the French side did not agree to an escrow account, which indicates that \"in case of any breach of agreement, the Indian party would have to first settle it through arbitration directly with the French vendors\".\n",
      "146 \n",
      " \"If the arbitration award were in favor of Indian party and the French vendor fails to honor the award (make the payment's claim), the Indian party should exhaust all available legal remedies. Only then the French government would make these payments on behalf of the vendors,\" the report says. It also includes the NDA's response on this matter. \"The ministry, in its reply, stated that the IGA had been signed between two strategic partners who are sovereign nations with a long-standing strategic relationship,\" it said.\n",
      "147 \n",
      " Furthermore, it also turns out that the Modi government's 36-jet deal won't get the aircraft to India much sooner than the UPA's deal would have. The actual advantage would be of a month in terms of delivery. This technically tallies with the government's claims that NDA's deal will bring the jets home faster, but a one-month advantage isn't anything to write home about. However, it must be mentioned here that the delivery schedule of the first 18 Rafale aircraft will beat the UPA's deal by five months, according to the CAG report.\n",
      "148 \n",
      " In sum, with this CAG report, Rahul would have got enough talking points for the election season to challenge the Modi government's claims on Rafale. But he destroyed his chance by calling the CAG \"Chowkidar Auditor General\", its report \"worthless\" and \"Narendra Modi's report, written for the chowkidar, on behalf of the chowkidar and by the chowkidar\", even before the report was tabled in Parliament.\n",
      "149 \n",
      " This is sheer political immaturity, and for this sense of poor timing, the Congress president gave BJP the chance to interpret the CAG report, which is critical of the deal in various ways, as a \"vindication\" of the party's stance. Rahul doubled down on his claims by saying that the CAG report is \"not worth the paper it is written on\". But when someone tries to run down the credibility of every constitutional authority, including the Supreme Court and the CAG, the ultimate blow is self-inflicted.\n",
      "150 \n",
      " Prime Minister Narendra Modi is implicated in a snowballing scandal related to the procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets from France. Former French President Francois Hollande revealed in an interview released on September 21, 2018, that France did not have any other choice except for one company recommended by New Delhi for the deal. Owned by Anil Ambani, Reliance Aerostructure Limited – with no experience in aerospace manufacturing – became French aviation company Dassault Rafale's partner in India.\n",
      "151 \n",
      " On Friday, Hollande, who was responsible for clearing the deal between the governments during his tenure, was quoted as stating that New Delhi had pressured Dassault to choose Reliance. Anil Ambani is the son of the late Dhirubhai Ambani, one of India’s most powerful and richest business moguls. Hollande stated, “We did not have a say in this. The Indian government proposed this group, and Dassault [the company that manufactured the jets] negotiated with Ambani. We did not have a choice, we took the interlocutor who was given to us.”\n",
      "152 \n",
      " Investigative journalists Karl Laske and Anton Rouget reported that Ambani’s Reliance Defence provided funding for a film produced by President Hollande’s partner, actress Julie Gayet. Ambani funded Gayet's film when the deal for 36 fighter jets with Reliance was completed. While Reliance appeared in the film’s credits, it was not mentioned in financing details presented to France’s public body responsible for cinema. The film did not mention India, or distribute in it. Former President Hollande is likely speaking now given the focus on his partner’s film relative to the deal. In an attempt to deny this, he has declared the Reliance Defence was picked because France was given no choice by the Indian government. “I could not even imagine that there was any connection to a film by Julie Gayet,” he stated.\n",
      "153 \n",
      " The focus of the scandal rests on Prime Minister Modi’s sudden decision to secretly end a previous deal that sought 18 fighter jets from France and largely focused on training the local workforce through the transfer of technology. Instead of relying on foreign imports, the previous government led by the Congress party aimed at manufacturing 108 aircrafts in India. But Modi single-handedly changed the terms of the deal and agreed to procure 36 fighter jets.\n",
      "154 \n",
      " Rahul Gandhi, Indian Congress president, has lashed out, calling it the \"biggest ever\" corruption scandal, accusing Prime Minister Modi of changing the deal to benefit “his friend” Anil Ambani. He declared, “The fun part is that the contract was given to Ambaniji, who has never made an aeroplane in his life nor has he ever taken a contract for defence.”\n",
      "155 \n",
      " India’s defense procurement rules mandate that foreign firms must invest at least 30 percent of contracts in India to build local technological capacity. Former ministers Arun Shourie and Yashwant Sinha have also criticised the deal, noting “Neither Reliance Defence nor any of its allied companies have any experience of manufacturing aerospace and defence equipment.” The original fighter jet deal was supposed to include Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), which activist lawyer Prashant Bushan noted “has over 60 years of experience in aircraft manufacturing ....”\n",
      "156 \n",
      " Bushan contrasts this to Reliance Defence, which he said is “a private party which has had absolutely no experience in manufacturing aerospace and defence equipment has been handed an enormous financial benefit.” To add to the controversy, critics point to the fact that Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group incorporated a defence company just 12 days before Modi announced the new Rafale deal. Ambani also accompanied Modi on his visit to France, resulting in accusations of a breach of confidence and cronyism. Reliance Defence’s responses to the allegations have neglected to mention ties between Modi and Ambani. Ambani had previously publicly called Modi \"king of kings.\"\n",
      "157 \n",
      " \"The PM personally negotiated and changed the Rafale deal behind closed doors. Thanks to François Hollande, we now know he personally delivered a deal worth billions of dollars to ... Anil Ambani,\" said Rahul Gandhi, president of opposition Congress party. “The prime minister has betrayed India,” he concluded. The breach of confidence allegations take on new strength in light of the highly secretive conditions of the changed deal, with  former defence minister Manohar Parrikar being informed about the deal only shortly before Modi left Paris to make the announcement. Even India’s foreign secretary was not informed about the deal. To add more confusion, Dassault CEO Eric Trappier recently made a public statement saying that the original 126-aircraft deal was “95 percent complete.”\n",
      "158 \n",
      " Anand Sharma, the opposition leader from the Congress party demanded that the prime minister respond to the charges made against him. At a news conference he said, “My direct charge is that the prime minister violated the oath of confidentiality. Only he could have told Anil Ambani that HAL [Hindustan Aerospace Limited] will be out and he will strike a deal to buy 36 jets, and ‘you’ [Ambani] go and talk to Dassault aviation [Rafale Jet Manufacturers].”\n",
      "159 \n",
      " While the most cited reason for the deal change is the “collapse of negotiations,” no response has been given on the illegality of Modi’s individual decision to change the deal without gaining approval of relevant cabinet committees, or undermining fellow ministers of Defence and Finance. The Indian Congress President Rahul Gandhi had previously accused the government of significant inconsistencies after the deal was announced, given that the finalised price from the initial deal went from $72.3 million (526 crore) to $2.3 billion (Rs 1670 crore), nearly triple the price.\n",
      "160 \n",
      " Additionally, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine had launched investigations into another deal for the purchase of spares for military transport aircrafts, with personal kickbacks worth $2.6 million (RS 17.55 crore) to Ministry of Defence Officials in the Modi government. The government did not to respond or provide details on the deal.\n",
      "161 \n",
      " Indian Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has hit back, stating that she did not even know who Dassault’s partner was, calling it “a commercial decision,” while procedure calls for partnership clearance in 2019. This is suspect however, given that Dassault and Reliance have publicly declared in joint-press releases that they were working together, with the foundation stone for their joint-manufacturing facility laid as early as October 2017 with Indian ministers in attendance.\n",

      "164 \n",
      " On the issue of missing Rafale files, Rahul said: \"Rafale files have disappeared like jobs for two crore youths, right price for farmers' produce and promise to give Rs 15 lakh.\" The Congress President said the government was saying the documents were missing, which only meant that the Rafale document were genuine. He added that media reports published on the basis of missing documents clearly said the \"PMO was carrying out parallel negotiations\".\n",
      "165 \n",
      " \"Yes of course, take action on those involved in this missing documents case but also initiate an inquiry on PMO for making parallel negotiations,\" Rahul Gandhi said, adding the missing papers clearly say that Narendra Modi had done \"bypass surgery\" in the Rafale deal.

Did something changed with the requirement of national security? Did the Air Force tell the government that we do not want 126 planes, we want only 36 planes?\n",
      "181 \n",
      " 02:15 pm: The questions of Rafale occur on three pillars. The first pillar is the process with regards to the deal. The second pillar is the pricing. And the third and the most interesting pillar is paisa, patronage, Gandhi said. 02:13 pm: He (PM Modi) spoke for almost one and a half hours... but did not answer the fundamental questions about Rafale, Rahul Gandhi said.\n",
      "182 \n",
      " 02:10 pm: It is a tragedy that the member of AIADMK are doing a service to the BJP by withholding this debate, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said as AIADMK MPs continued raising slogans.\n",

      " India's opposition parties are demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi over allegations of corruption in a multi-billion dollar fighter jet deal. Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the main opposition Congress party, has alleged that Mr Modi \"favoured\" an Indian company that is part of the French deal. Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has denied the allegation, saying the government signed the deal to meet the Indian Air Force's combat requirements and had no role in choosing the French manufacturer's local partner.\n",
      "184 \n",
      " The issue has caused a political storm in India, and much of the debate in TV news shows has revolved around it in the past few days. India, the world's second-largest defence importer in 2017, signed a government-to-government deal with France in 2016 to buy 36 Rafale warplanes manufactured by Dassault Aviation.\n",
      "185 \n",
      " With this deal, Delhi is hoping to modernise its Soviet-era air force fleet. The Rafale is a multi-role aircraft - capable of carrying out long-range missions, including conducting highly-accurate sea and ground attacks. The first Rafales are expected to be delivered by 2019 and India is set to have all 36 jets within six years.\n",
      "186 \n",
      " Mr Modi announced the deal in Paris along with then French President François Hollande. The Indian government said it had negotiated the \"best deal\" to strengthen its air combat capabilities. Almost two years later, the leaders seem to have different views on what they once described as an important deal.\n",
      "187 \n",
      " Mr Hollande sparked political controversy in India last week by telling French news website Mediapart that Mr Modi's government had pressured Dassault to partner with India's Reliance Defence to meet its \"offset policy\". The \"offset\" clause in Delhi's defence procurement rules says that foreign firms need to invest at least 30% of a deal's worth back in India. It was introduced in India's Defence Procurement Procedure in 2008 to boost domestic manufacturing.\n",
      "188 \n",
      " As part of the 2016 Rafale deal, Dassault agreed to invest 50% of the estimated $8.7bn (£6.6bn) contract in India to manufacture some components of the jet with billionaire Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence. Mr Hollande told Mediapart that his government didn't have a say in the matter. \"It was the Indian government who proposed this [Reliance] service group, and Dassault who negotiated with Ambani. We did not have a choice, we took the interlocutor who was given to us,\" he said.\n",
      "189 \n",
      " The Congress party has accused Mr Modi of practising crony capitalism by helping Anil Ambani's firm. \"The PM personally negotiated and changed the Rafale deal behind closed doors... The PM has betrayed India. He has dishonoured the blood of our soldiers,\" Mr Gandhi tweeted. He has demanded that the government order an inquiry into the deal.\n",
      "190 \n",
      " But ministers have rejected the allegation, saying Dassault was free to pick any competent Indian manufacturer. The French firm has also supported the Indian government's claim. \"This [the selection of Reliance] is Dassault Aviation's choice. This partnership has led to the creation of the Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd (DRAL) joint-venture in February 2017,\" it said.\n",
      "191 \n",
      " Mr Ambani has always denied any wrongdoing in the deal. He has previously said that the joint venture was agreed directly between his firm and Dassault, and that the government was not involved. The French government seems to have taken a cautious approach. Its statement does not directly contradict Mr Hollande, but emphasises that it did not have a role in Dassault's decisions.\n",
      "192 \n",
      " \"The French government is in no manner involved in the choice of Indian industrial partners who have been, are being, or will be selected by French companies,\" it said. The Congress party has also accused Mr Modi of compromising national security and destroying state-run defence manufacturing firms. It's a reality that India is facing a severe shortage of fighter jets. It would need 42 squadrons in the scenario of a two-front war with China and Pakistan. But its squadron strength has depleted to 31 - largely owing to ageing Russian aircraft.\n",
      "193 \n",
      " But this realisation is not new. The BJP government in 2000 decided to buy new fighter jets. Its successor Congress continued the process and issued tenders in 2008 to buy 126 jets. Dassault was finalised as a supplier in 2012, and the state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) was selected as partner to produce 108 jets in India.\n",
      "194 \n",
      " But the two partners couldn't agree on terms and conditions, and the deal stalled. When Mr Modi swept to power in 2014, he made the procurement of the jets one of his priorities. But instead of taking the deal forward, he surprised many by ordering 36 jets as part of a new deal in which HAL was not included.\n",
      "195 \n",
      " The Indian government says it decided to buy the 36 jets in \"fly-away\" condition to quickly address the problem of the air force's depleting strength. But it's not clear where India will procure the remaining aircraft it needs in the long term. In April, the air force announced it would be seeking bids for around 110 more fighter jets.\n",
      "196 \n",
      " The Congress party has also accused Mr Modi of paying more than what its government had negotiated in 2012 on a per aircraft basis. But there are no details available about how much the government has agreed to pay Dassault. Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman earlier said that she would disclose cost details to prove Congress wrong. But she later said the government would not do so because the information was classified.\n",
      "197 \n",
      " The absence of such details has given more political ammunition to the Congress party ahead of next year's general elections. While senior ministers have come out to defend the BJP leader, Mr Modi's silence on the matter has helped the opposition's case. The BJP said the government needed to fight a \"perception battle\" with opposition parties. But until Mr Modi speaks, it's going to be a tough task because people want answers from the man they elected to lead India.\n",

      " AHMEDABAD: The BJP won all the 26 Lok Sabha seats at stake in Gujarat as the people in the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi stood firmly behind him for the second time after 2014.The BJP got a vote share of over 62 per cent in Gujarat and the minimum margin of its victory was 1.27 lakh votes, reflecting the massive scale of saffron sweep.Like in 2014, the Congress failed to open its account this time around also.The Rahul Gandhi-led party had put up a spirited fight in the 2017 assembly polls in Gujarat, but failed to carry forward the momentum in the 2019 general election.While Modi did not contest election from the state this time, BJP chief Amit Shah, who also hails from Gujarat, won by a huge margin from Gandhingar in his maiden Lok Sabha election foray.In 2014, Modi had won from Vadodara, but vacated the seat later and retained Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, his second Lok Sabha constituency.The process of counting of votes continued till Friday morning and the last result came at around 10 am.Declaration of results took time due to counting of VVPAT (Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail) slips, said a poll official.The VVPAT enables the verification of results displayed from the EVM during counting.Shah won from Gandhinagar -- a seat earlier held by BJP patriarch L K Advani -- by 5.57 lakh votes, defeating Congress rival C J Chavda.Shah polled 8.94 lakh votes, while Chavda got 3.37 lakh ballots.In 2014, the BJP had won all the 26 seats when Modi, the then Gujarat chief minister, was the BJP's prime ministerial candidate.This time when he was in contention for a second term as Prime Minister, the voters of the state firmly stood behind him.The victory margin of the BJP's Navsari candidate, C R Patil -- 6.89 lakh -- was the highest in all the 26 seats.Patil had won the 2014 Lok Sabha election from Navsari by a margin of 5.58 lakh votes.In Vadodara, BJP candidate Ranjan Bhatt won by a margin of over 5.84 lakh votes against Congress's Prashant Patel.Notably, she has crossed Modi's victory margin of 5.70 lakh in the 2014 elections from Vadodara.In Surat, BJP's Darshana Jardosh won by 5.48 lakh votes, defeating Congress candidate Ashok Patel.In Jamnagar, BJP's Poonam Madam won by over 2.36 lakh votes, defeating Congress candidate Mulu Kandoriya.BJP's Mitesh Patel won from Anand, defeating Congress candidate and former Union minister Bharat Solanki by a margin of 1.97 lakh votes.In Bardoli, BJP's Parbhu Vasava defeated Congress candidate Tushar Chaudhary by 2.15 lakh votes.BJP candidate from Chhota Udepur, Gitaben Rathva, won by a margin of 3.77 lakh votes, defeating Congress candidate Ranjitsinh Rathva.BJP's Mohan Kundariya won the Rajkot seat by a margin of 3.68 lakh votes, defeating Congress's Lalit Kagathara.BJP candidates won by over 3 lakh votes inValsad, Panchmahal, Kheda, Kutch, Ahmedabad (East), Ahmedabad (West), Banaskantha, Bharuch and Bhavnagar.The lowest victory gap of a BJP candidate was in Dhahod, where its nominee Jaswantsinh Bhabhor, a minister in the Modi government, won by 1.27 lakh votes.Expressing happiness over the BJP's grand victory, chief minister Vijay Rupani said the credit for this outcome goes to the people of the state.\"Political pundits could not see the Modi wave until the exit polls. Today this wave is clear from the results.\"It is the victory of the people of the country. It reflects their faith in Narendra Modi and his honest and decisive leadership,\" he said.The Congress accepted the defeat.\"This is the verdict of the people of the country and we accept it. We will try to find out our faults and rectify them,\" state Congress president Amit Chavda said.In 2014 too, the Congress had lost all the 26 seats in Gujarat.However, in the 2017 assembly polls, the party put up a tough fight, but the BJP managed to retain power with a slender majority.BJP workers started frenzied celebrations across the state.Heeraba Modi, the nonagenarian mother of the prime minister, briefly joined the celebrations by greeting people who had gathered outside her house in Kudasan village on the outskirts of Gandhinagar.\n",

      " The Union government on Wednesday raised objections to sharing the pricing/cost of 36 Rafale fighter jets with the Supreme Court in a sealed cover, saying it was not divulged even to the parliament.  Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, heading 3-judge bench, told Attorney-General K.K. Venugopal to file an affidavit spelling out the government's objections to disclosing the price fixed for procuring the 36 aircraft from France's Dassault company.\n",
      "200 \n",
      "  \"Please file an affidavit saying why your are not sharing... if you have any difficulty, say so. We will hear that,\" Chief Justice Gogoi told Mr. Venugopal.  The government protested after the court recorded in its order that it \"would also like to be apprised of the details with regard to the pricing/cost and advantages, if any\".\n",
      "201 \n",
      "  Later, one of the petitioners, Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh, said the price of the aircraft should be disclosed.  \"Do you know the price?\" Chief Justice Gogoi asked him.  When Mr. Singh replied in the affirmative, the Chief Justice said: \"You keep it to yourself... you are one of the fortunates who know the price\".\n",
      "202 \n",
      "  Besides Mr. Singh, the petitioners include former union ministers Yashwant Sinha, Arun Shourie — who were at the court, advocates Prashant Bhushan and M.L. Sharma — who had filed the first petition in the apex court against the Rafale deal.  The petitions, the court pointed out, have not raised questions about the \"suitability\" of the Rafale fighter jets or its \"utility to the Indian Air Force\".\n",
      "203 \n",
      "  \"What has been questioned is the bonafide-ness of the decision-making process and the price/cost of the equipment for which the same has been procured,\" the Chief Justice explained the ambit of the various petitions in  the court's order.  The Bench, also comprising Justices U.U. Lalit and K.M. Joseph, said it has perused the note/report given to the court in a sealed cover by the government, detailing the various stages of the decision-making process leading to the award of the 36 fighter jets.\n",
      "204 \n",
      " The court ordered the government to share with petitioners and parties such information contained in the note which could be \"legitimately put out in the public domain\".  Again, the Bench directed the government to make available whatever information which could be \"legitimately placed in the public domain\" about the induction of the Indian off-set partner, if any, in the Rafale deal.\n",
      "205 \n",
      "  The petitioners had raised questions about  “how a novice company viz. Reliance Defence came in picture of this highly sensitive defence deal involving Rs. 59,000 crore without having any kind of experience and expertise in making of fighter jets”. They had sought an explanation on why Hindustan Aeronautics Limited was removed from the deal.\n",
      "206 \n",
      "  The court clarified in its order that any information in the note which is either strategic or confidential in nature may not, at this stage, be furnished to the petitioners or parties.  Mr. Venugopal submitted that many details in the note may be hit by the Official Secrets Act and exempt from public disclosure.\n",
      "207 \n",
      "  \"Please read our order, Mr. Attorney. We said 'whatever information which can be legitimately placed in public domain',\" the Chief Justice responded.  The court gave the government 10 days to share the necessary information from its note with the petitioners. They, in turn, can filed their responses in seven days thereafter. The court fixed the hearing for November 14.\n",
      "208 \n",
      "  Mr. Sharma wanted the hearing to be adjourned till after the elections. He conveyed this to the Chief Justice at the very beginning of the hearing. He said \"elections\" were due.  \"How are we concerned? When has the business of this court stopped for elections.. By the way, what elections are you talking about?\" Chief Justice Gogoi asked him.\n",
      "209 \n",
      "  Mr. Sharma hesitatingly referred to the \"Assembly elections\". To this, the CJI snubbed him, saying \"first you decide what elections you have in mind\".  Mr. Bhushan, who jointly moved the Supreme Court with the two former ministers for a CBI probe into the Rafale deal, said he had earlier filed a complaint with the CBI. He said there was no word from the CBI about his complaint.\n",
      "210 \n",
      "  \"For that you will have to wait, Mr. Bhushan. Let the CBI put its house in order first,\" the Chief Justice said.  The top judge was obliquely referring to the power feud between top CBI officials and the ongoing investigation into exiled CBI Director Alok Verma and Special Director R.K. Asthana, which has shaken the credibility of the premier agency.\n",
      "211 \n",
      "  The trio's petition contended that tenders were originally issued by the Ministry of Defence in 2007 for the purchase of 126 fighter aircraft. According to this deal, they contended, the Request for Proposal showed 18 of the jets would be purchased from abroad in a ‘fly-away’ condition and the remaining 108 would be manufactured in India in the factory of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) with transfer of technology from the foreign vendor.\n",
      "212 \n",
      "  Six companies had applied. Dassault was declared the lowest tenderer and thereafter price negotiations began. These negotiations were at a very advanced stage (95% complete) by March 25, 2015.  “However within 15 days of this, the Prime Minister of India and the President of France announced a totally new deal jettisoning the virtually complete 126 aircraft deal and the Prime Minister on behalf of India agreed to purchase only 36 Rafale aircraft in a ‘fly-away’ condition without any transfer of technology and make in India,” the petition said.\n",
      "213 \n",
      "  “It later turned out that the new deal involved 50% of the value of the contract to be given as “offset contracts” to Indian companies and that the government informally told Dassault and the French government that the bulk of the offset contracts would have to be given to a company of Mr. Anil Ambani which had just been set up,” the petition said.\n",
      "214 \n",
      "  The petition alleged that “when the final contract was signed after price negotiations, it was transpired that the price of the aircraft had been increased to more than double to what was under consideration in the old deal of 126 aircraft”.  It said the alleged actions of the “various public servants” amount to offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act.\n",
      "215 \n",
      "  Mr. Singh's petition has urged the court to “restore the earlier deal for the purchase of 126 Rafale Fighter Jets which was cancelled on June 24, 2015 by the Government of India” and propose Hindustan Aeronautics Limited as the Indian offset partner of Dassault in the Rafale deal.\n",
      "216 \n",
      " There is no question of an FIR, much less a CBI investigation, into the 36 Rafale aircraft purchase, the government told the Supreme Court on May 25. There is no need for a probe as the Supreme Court itself, in a December 14, 2018 judgment, found it unnecessary to intervene in the sensitive defence purchase, it said.\n",
      "217 \n",
      " “Once the Supreme Court had come to the conclusion that on all the three aspects i.e., the decision-making process, pricing and Indian Offset Partner, there is no reason for intervention on the sensitive issue of purchase of 36 Rafale fighter aircraft by the government, there is no question of registration of FIR much less any investigation by the CBI,” the Union of India said in its 39-page written submission filed in the Supreme Court.\n",
      "218 \n",
      " The submission is in response to the review and perjury petitions filed by petitioners and former Union Ministers Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie and lawyer Prashant Bhushan alleging the government had concealed crucial facts and misled the apex court into giving a verdict favourable to the Rafale deal. The petitioners had said their detailed complaint with the CBI for a probe was ignored. There had not been an attempt to even register an FIR or enquire into the complaint.\n",
      "219 \n",
      " But the government countered there was no element of criminality as the Comptroller and Auditor-General (CAG) had rubbished claims that each jet was priced ₹1,000 crore more than the earlier aborted deal by the UPA government with Dassault for 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA), the government said. “In fact, the CAG has held that the 36 Rafale aircraft deal is 2.86% lower than the audit aligned price and in addition, there would be benefits on account of non-firm and fixed price. This itself negates the case of the petitioners of a prima facie criminal offence having been committed due to the payment of higher prices,” the government, represented by Attorney-General K.K. Venugopal and R. Balasubramaniam, submitted.\n",
      "220 \n",
      " The government said an enquiry need to be launched only if the complaint prima facie disclosed commission of cognizable offence. Even this, according to the government, was “lacking in the present case”. The government denied misleading the court into believing that the CAG report was already submitted in Parliament before the December 14 verdict was rendered. The petitioners had said the court was made to believe this by the government when the reality was there was no such report at that point of time. The report was filed in Parliament only on February 15, 2019.\n",
      "221 \n",
      " But the government dismissed the error as “misunderstanding of language” about which the petitioners had created a “big hue and cry”. The Centre said the petitioners’ claim that the government tried to mislead the court was “completely false and preposterous”. The government claimed it was as transparent as it could be while dealing with a sensitive defence purchase. It said the basic price of the aircraft was informed to Parliament as approximately ₹670 crore at the prevailing exchange rate of November 2016 without associated equipment, weapons, India-specific enhancements, maintenance support and services. The price built up and a comparison with the price of the flyaway aircraft in the MMRCA bid was submitted to the Supreme Court in a sealed cover. All pricing details, files, documents and records were made available to the team of the CAG which worked out its own aligned cost.\n",
      "222 \n",
      " A review petition should not be a nomenclature for a “fishing and roving enquiry” on the basis of individual perceptions, the Centre said. The government dismissed contentions by the petitioners about the benchmark price being exorbitantly high as a completely misleading allegation based on incomplete file noting and faulty assertions.\n",
      "223 \n",
      " It said the waiver of sovereign/bank guarantee in government to government agreements/contracts was not unusual. “So far as the selection of Indian Offset Partners (IOPs) is concerned, there is no mention of any private Indian Business House(s) in IGA or Offset Contract,” it said. The deal was based on the final decisions taken by competent authorities, i.e., the Defence Minister, the Defence Acquisition Council and the Cabinet Committee on Security.\n",
      "224 \n",
      " The Centre said allegations like “Defence Minister was not consulted, Reliance Group paid €1.48 million to then French President Francois Hollande’s partner’s venture and RAL was not a legitimate offset partner” were based on unsubstantiated media reports. The agreement for the jets’ procurement was “between the two sovereign nations and the implementation of the project which is on schedule is being closely monitored by both the governments”. Any delay in the implementation would affect the operational preparedness of the Air Force, the government said.\n",
      "225 \n",
      " A day after Congress president Rahul Gandhi trained the guns on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the controversial Rafale deal in a press conference, he has taken to Twitter to launch a fresh attack. \"Globalised corruption. This #Rafale aircraft really does fly far and fast! It's also going to drop some big bunker buster bombs in the next couple of weeks,\" Gandhi tweeted this morning.\n",
      "226 \n",
      " The tweet also referred to a story by The Indian Express claiming that Anil Ambani's Reliance Entertainment had signed a deal to produce a film with actor Julie Gayet, then French President Francois Hollande's partner, just two days before the MoU for Rafale aircraft was signed. \"Modi Ji please tell Anil, there is a big problem in France,\" Gandhi's tweet added.\n",
      "227 \n",
      " Yesterday, at the press conference, Rahul Gandhi had read excerpts from the joint statement by Modi and Hollande that had been issued in Paris in April 2016 and straight up accused the Prime Minister of lying. \"The two leaders agreed that the aircraft and associated systems and weapons would be delivered on the same configuration as had been tested and approved by Indian Air Force,\" Gandhi had said, quoting the joint statement, and added that the PM is \"saying something else\" now. \"It is clearly written here that the configuration is going to be the same. So, the man is lying,\" Gandhi said.\n",
      "228 \n",
      " The Congress leader further questioned why a fighter jet worth Rs 520 crore was bought for Rs 1,600 crore. He even challenged the Modi government to form a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to scrutinise the Rafale deal. According to media reports, Gandhi also took on the Rs 5,000 crore defamation suit filed by Reliance Defence, Reliance Infrastructure and Reliance Aerostructure - all belonging to the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group - against the Congress-owned 'National Herald'. The civil suit claimed an article published in the newspaper regarding the Rafale fighter deal was \"libellous and derogatory\".\n",
      "229 \n",
      " At the press conference, Gandhi did not hold back any punches and said, \"Slap as many defamation suits as you want, but the truth remains that just as demonetisation was done to help the prime minister's crony capitalist friends, the Rafale deal was done to benefit Anil Ambani's group\". He added that Ambani had never made aircraft and had floated his defence firm \"only few days\" before the Rafale contract was signed. \"On the other hand, there is the HAL (Hindustan Aeronautics Limited), which is making aircraft for 70 years. It has no debt. There are thousands of engineers who want to work,\" Gandhi said, adding, \"What is the deal between Anil Ambani and Prime Minister Narendra Modi\".\n",
      "230 \n",
      " To remind you, Rafale is a French twin-engine multi-role fighter jet designed and built by Dassault Aviation. Rafale jets are considered to be one of the most potent combat jets globally. India and France signed a deal worth 7.87 billion euros (Rs 59,000 crore approximately) on September 23, 2016, for 36 Rafale jets. The delivery of the aircraft will start from September 2019.\n",
      "231 \n",
      " Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who recently got back to North Block after recovering from his kidney transplant, has countered Gandhi's claims on Twitter. \"Any issue diversion by @RahulGandhi on my Rafale questions, will not wipe out his falsehood on Rafale,\" he tweeted yesterday. In another tweet he claimed that \"The fully weaponised Rafale air craft's 2016 price is 20% cheaper than the 2007 offer. This is what the 2015 statement of the PM and the French President refers to as 'on terms better than the 2007 offers'.\"\n",
      "232 \n",
      " But the Congress party is unlikely to let the Rafale deal controversy die out in a hurry in the run up to general elections next year.\n",
      "233 \n",
      " Congress president Rahul Gandhi said his party will do an “objective inquiry” into the Rafale deal if it comes to power.  “What we will do is an objective inquiry, not a vindictive one. It won’t be a witch-hunt,” Gandhi told Outlook in an exclusive interview. He said the Rafale deal is ‘seriously problematic” and it needs to be investigated.\n",
      "234 \n",
      " On being asked that when he talks about probing Rafale, does he mean probing industrialist Anil Ambani or will he probe PM Narendra Modi too, the Congress chief replied, “You don’t probe an individual, you find out if the law was broken. And if the law was broken, you take action against those who broke it.”\n",
      "235 \n",
      " “Procedure was broken, the French President clearly says that he was told certain things by the Indian PM; Defence Ministry officials have raised serious objections in writing about the parallel negotiations been undertaken by the PMO and those objections have even been published in The Hindu. The Rafale deal is seriously problematic and it has to be investigated,’ he said.\n",

Periodical enquiries by the PMO cannot be construed as interference,\" she clarified. The Opposition raised the issue in both the Houses, with the Rajya Sabha adjourned for the day.

BJP, however, rejected the charge, saying the email purportedly by an Airbus executive referred to a helicopter deal and not Rafale.\n",

      " Gandhi released to the media an email dated March 28, 2015 purportedly written by Airbus executive Nicolas Chamussy to three recipients with the subject line \"Ambani\". He claimed the email showed Ambani visited then French defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian’s office and mentioned an \"MoU in preparation and the intention to sign during the PM visit (to France)\".\n",
      "311 \n",
      " The Congress president asked how Ambani knew about the deal and mentioned  it in the French defence minister’s office when even then foreign secretary S Jaishankar and then defence minister Manohar Parrikar had no information on it. \"This is a breach of the Official Secrets Act. The prime minister who is the only other person who knows about the deal has informed Anil Ambani about the deal. The Prime Minister is acting as Anil Ambani’s middleman,\" Gandhi alleged and called for a criminal investigation into the matter.\n",
      "312 \n",
      " The government and Ambani have repeatedly denied all allegations related to the Rafale deal. According to Gandhi, it was earlier an issue of corruption, of procedural inconsistencies but was now a matter related to the Official Secrets Act which he said was \"much more serious’. \"This is now treason, nothing less. Mr Narendra Modi is doing what spies do. He is informing somebody of defence matters, he is under oath to protect these secrets.\n",
      "313 \n",
      " \"He has now given this secret to Mr Anil Ambani who knows that the biggest defence deal in the world is going to him 10 days before the deal…This itself is criminal, this itself will put the prime minister in jail,\" the Congress chief said. Rebutting Gandhi’s allegations, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said his party had serious differences with former prime ministers, who came from the Gandhi family, over several \"murky\" defence deals signed during their term but had never accused them of treason.\n",

      " He read out the email at the press conference, quoting it as saying that Ambani visited the defence minister’s office and \"told them he intends to work with AH (Airbus Helicopters) on commercial helos and then on defence. Mentioned (an) MoU in preparation and the intention to sign during the PM visit\".\n",
      "316 \n",
      " \"This is literally handing over a defence secret…The prime minister has compromised national security. He has done what a spy does. He has given defence information to a person who is not supposed to have it,\" Gandhi alleged. \"Why don’t you allow a JPC…You can investigate us as much as you want,\" he said in response to a question.\n",

Earlier the government had claimed \"privilege\" over the leaked Rafale documents under Section 123 of the Indian Evidence Act and told the SC these papers couldn't be considered as bases to re-examine its verdict on the controversial Rafale fighter jet deal.

According to the 'offset clause' of the contract, Dassault Aviation, which manufactures the Rafale fighter jet, must select an Indian partner from which it must source 50 per cent of the value of the contract, in order to boost local manufacturing.\n",
      "339 \n",
      " According to Defence Ministry, the government has no role to play in the 'offset' contract, and the manufacturer - Dassault Aviation - can choose an Indian partner of its choice. However, an interview published by a French publication on Friday completely contradicts this. The interview published in the French publication quoted former French President Francois Hollande as saying that the Indian government was the one which proposed Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence as Dassault Aviation's partner in multi-billion dollar Rafale jet deal, and that France did not have a choice. This has created a political storm, with the opposition Congress, led by Rahul Gandhi squarely putting the blame on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n",

(Saint-Cloud, France September 21, 2018) - Dassault Aviation provides the following clarifications regarding the contract signed in 2016 for 36 Rafale aircraft to India:\n",

      " 1. This contract is a government-to-government agreement. It provides for a separate contract in which Dassault Aviation commits to make compensation investments (offsets) in India worth 50% of the value of the purchase. 2. This offsets contract is delivered in compliance with the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) 2016 regulations. In this framework, and in accordance with the policy of Make in India, Dassault Aviation has decided to make a partnership with India's Reliance Group. This is Dassault Aviation's choice, as CEO Eric Trappier had explained in an interview published in MINT newspaper on April 17, 2018. This partnership has led to the creation of the Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd (DRAL) joint-venture in February 2017. Dassault Aviation and Reliance have built a plant in Nagpur for manufacturing parts for Falcon and Rafale aircraft. The Nagpur site was chosen because of the availability of land with direct access to an airport runway, an essential condition of aeronautic activities.\n",

      " NEW DELHI: Congress President Rahul Gandhi expressed \"regret\" in the Supreme Court on Monday over his remarks in connection with the Rafale judgment, which the apex court had said was \"incorrectly attributed\" to it, saying it was made in the \"heat of political campaigning\".The apex court on April 15 had given a categorical clarification that in its Rafale verdict there was no occasion for it to make a mention of the contemptuous observation that \" chowkidar Narendra Modi chor hain\" as has been attributed to it by Gandhi.The court had directed Gandhi to give his explanation on April 22 on a petition filed by BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi seeking criminal contempt action against him for his remarks. It is scheduled to hear Lekhi's petition on Tuesday.Gandhi, who filed an affidavit in response to the apex court's order, said his statement was \"purely political\" and was made to counter the \"misinformation campaign\" being led by senior BJP functionaries as well as the Government that the December 14 last year judgment gave a \"clean chit\" to the Modi government on the Rafale deal.He also referred to a media interview by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in which he had said that the apex court had given a clean chit to the government in the Rafale deal.He maintained that there was no \"slightest intention\" to \"insinuate\" anything regarding the Supreme Court proceedings in any manner as he holds the top court in the highest esteem.Clarifying further, Gandhi said he had made the statement after filing his nomination paper on April 10 without \"having seen or read the order\" of the apex court passed on that day relating to the admissibility of certain documents related to the Rafale case in the review petition.However, on the issue of slogan 'Chowkidar chor hai', Gandhi in his affidavit re-affirmed his stand and belief and that of his party that Rafale deal is a \"tainted transaction\" and a \"gross and brazen abuse of executive power and a leading example of the corruption of the BJP Government led by Prime Minister Modi, which deserves to be investigated thoroughly by a Joint Parliamentary Committee and proceeded against thereafter\".He maintained that criminal contempt petition filed by Lekhi is seeking to drag the court into a \"political controversy for personal gains and political mileage\" with ulterior motive to gag him in a political discourse in the ongoing elections.Gandhi said on April 10, his political statement and issues relating to court proceedings \"unfortunately got juxtaposed and mingled with a political slogan being used extensively\" by Congress party as well as by him for the last several months, \"which is a matter of intense and frenzied public debate during the ongoing Lok Sabha elections\".In his 26-page affidavit, he said: \"My statement was made in the heat of political campaigning. It has been used (and misused) by my political opponents to project that I had deliberately and intentionally suggested that this Court had said 'Chowkidar Chor Hai'. Nothing could be farther from my mind.\"It is also clear that no court would ever do that and hence the unfortunate references (for which I express regret) to the court order and to the political slogan in juxtaposition the same breath in the heat of political campaigning ought not to be construed as suggesting that the court had given any finding or conclusion on that issue.\"Gandhi said the statement made by him was not even remotely intended to do anything to \"lower the majesty of this Court in any manner whatsoever\".\"There is no intention, direct, indirect, remote, implied or an attempt in any other manner to violate any court order, obstruct the administration of justice, or prejudice or interfere with the due course of any judicial proceedings, or scandalize the court in any manner,\" he said.\"The said statements were made by the answering Respondent in Hindi in a rhetorical flourish in the heat of the moment. It was during a political campaign without a readable copy of the Supreme Court order being available on its website and, therefore, without the answering Respondent having seen or read the order and relying upon electronic and social media reportage and the version of workers and activists surrounding him,\" he added.A bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi on April 15 had decided to consider the criminal contempt petition filed by Lekhi against Gandhi for attributing to it some observations that were not in the Rafale judgment.It had observed that politicians should not attribute any findings or views to the court in their speeches.In the affidavit, Gandhi has said he \"undertakes that he will not attribute any views, observations or findings to the court in political address to the media and in public speeches, unless such views, observations or findings are recorded by the court\".In her plea, Lekhi, the Lok Sabha MP from New Delhi constituency, has alleged that Gandhi has attributed his personal remarks to the top court and tried to create prejudice.The Rafale fighter is a twin-engine Medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft manufactured by French aerospace company Dassault Aviation.A deal to procure the jets was signed between India and France in 2015. The delivery is expected to begin in September this year.\n",
      "349 \n",
      " November 17, 2017, now seems like an impossibly long time ago in the context of the Rafale deal. It was on that day that Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman addressed a press conference and promised that the difference between her government and the Congress, particularly on how it decided to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets instead of the 126 that were being negotiated earlier, would be transparency. “There is nothing that is going to stick on this government because everything is being done transparently and as per procedure,” Sitharaman had said. “There is just no comparison between the ways in which [Congress-led] UPA [United Progressive Alliance] took decisions and the way in which NDA takes decisions, because we have made both simpler, smoother, faster and above all transparent.”\n",
      "350 \n",
      " Simpler, smoother and maybe even faster might be true. But the Bharatiya Janata Party-run government’s behaviour cannot by any definition be described as transparent. To this day it is unclear why Prime Minister Narendra Modi altered the deal from 126 jets to 36 jets, without keeping his own ministers, bureaucrats or the Air Force in the loop. To this day, we do not have a definitive answer on the price of the planes, despite Sitharaman saying at that press conference, “I’m not running away from giving you specific numbers... because those are public money.” To this day it is unclear why an open tender to discover the best price was not held, if indeed the package that Dassault, Rafale’s manufacturer, is now giving India is radically different from the one the previous government was negotiating.\n",
      "351 \n",
      " And to this day, there is not a straightforward answer on whether the government proposed Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group as part of a “new formula” for the Rafale deal, as former French President Francois Hollande has alleged. Of course, the Indian government has insisted that it had no role in Dassault’s decision to finally go with Anil Ambani’s firm as part of its obligations under the deal. But has it categorically stated that it did not propose Reliance Defence? Sure, the government has suggested that Hollande somehow coordinated his statement with Congress President Rahul Gandhi. But has it definitely denied his remarks and said that the former French President is lying?\n",
      "352 \n",
      " The BJP government came to power on an anti-corruption platform, accusing the Congress-run United Progressive Alliance of all sorts of crony actions and greased palms. It promised development. It insisted that power would be accountable. The Rafale deal has shown all this to be false: Modi made a decision without any consultation, with no regard for procedure, and there are now credible allegations of corruption or at least crony capitalism from no less than the former foreign head of state that negotiated the deal.\n",
      "353 \n",
      " And when asked questions about it, the government and party have decided to point fingers at Pakistan. Is this what Modi’s transparency looks like?\n",
      "354 \n",
      " It was February 22, 2011 - the first day of the budget session when UPA was in power. The then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced setting up of a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) into the alleged multi-crore 2G spectrum allocation scam. For the next three years till the 2014 Lok Sabha election, 2G had become one of the most important issues for the BJP to corner the ruling Congress-led UPA government.\n",
      "355 \n",
      " In a reversal of roles now, the Congress is demanding a JPC probe into the Rafale deal. Congress president Rahul Gandhi has upped the ante over the issue. The ruling BJP has so far shown no inkling of giving in to Rahul Gandhis demand. Why is Rahul Gandhi demanding a JPC probe into the Rafale deal? What gains will the probe accrue to him and the Congress party?\n",
      "356 \n",
      " If one looks at the history of all JPCs, one finds that they serve as an important political tool for the opposition party. So far, JPCs have been constituted on six occasions - Bofors scam (1987), Harshad Mehta stock market scam (1992), Ketan Parekh share market scam (2001), soft drink pesticide issue (2003), 2G spectrum allocation scam (2011) and VVIP chopper scam (2013).\n",
      "357 \n",
      " While JPC was first constituted in the Bofors scandal when Rajiv Gandhi was the prime minister, the last two JPCs, including the one on 2G spectrum allocation, were formed during Manmohan Singhs second tenure as PM. Coincidentally, every time that the JPC has been constituted, the government of the day has lost in the next Lok Sabha election.\n",
      "358 \n",
      " From the Oppositions point of view, these are some of the five advantages of a JPC: Any JPC inquiry helps the Opposition in building up the heat on the ruling party of the day. The 2G did exactly that for the then main opposition party, the BJP. The Congress and its UPA partners were put on the defensive.\n",
      "359 \n",
      " The BJP kept demanding a JPC probe into 2G spectrum scam. When it was finally constituted, it remained in the news because if its meetings. Documents and heated arguments during its meetings would also be leaked thus keeping the pot boiling all the time. The Congress, therefore, wants the BJP to face the heat through a JPC on the Rafale deal.\n",
      "360 \n",
      " READ | Rahul Gandhi on Rafale: We don't take PM Modi seriously but expose his lies A JPC probe provides an official sanction to an alleged scam. The BJP was luckier than the Congress. The 2G spectrum scam found mention in Comptroller and Auditor Generals report which pegged the loss at Rs 1.76 lakh crore to the exchequer. The scam was probed by the CBI under the watch of the Supreme Court. The Rafale deal has not been taken up by any of these bodies. In the absence of such factor, Rahul Gandhi and the Congress may want a JPC inquiry for the Rafale deal to get some kind of an official sanction.\n",
      "361 \n",
      " Whatever may have been the truth in the Bofors, 2G spectrum or the VVIP chopper scams, they have got associated with the Congress governments of the day. The JPC probe had a big role to play in all of these. The Opposition parties, VP Singhs Janata Dal and the BJP respectively, were successful in creating a perception among the people of wrongdoings by the government. The JPC probe came in handy for the Opposition.\n",
      "362 \n",
      " If the Congress succeeds in getting a JPC inquiry ordered, it would go to town with the deliberations of the JPC meetings and finally its report and all the controversies surrounding it. Rahul Gandhis demand for a JPC probe into the Rafale deal may be a precursor to the worse things to come. It may be an alibi to disrupt the winter session of Parliament. The whole winter session of Parliament in 2010 had got washed out with the BJP demanding a JPC probe into the 2G scam. Though the BJP created the ruckus, the ruling Congress felt the heat.\n",
      "363 \n",
      " To escape any further embarrassment, the then PM Manmohan Singh announced the formation of JPC on 2G spectrum scam on the very first day of the 2011 budget session. The JPC meetings went on till more than two years and finally, its report was submitted by its chairman PC Chacko to the then Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar on October 29, 2013.\n",
      "364 \n",
      " Parliament was disrupted even on the adoption of the report. One may expect the same if a JPC probe is ordered into the Rafale deal. Finally, the main motive. The BJP was successful in creating a perception about the Congress government being corrupt. The JPC probe into the 2G spectrum scam played a key role. It provided a legitimacy for the BJP which went to the 2014 Lok Sabha election painting the Congress-led UPA government as corrupt. It paid rich dividends and the Congress fared the worst in history winning just 44 of the 543 Lok Sabha seats.\n",
      "365 \n",
      " With no other scam having stuck to the Narendra Modi government so far, the Congress smells a chance in the Rafale deal. Rahul Gandhi has been trying to rake it up on all forums. Now, his emphasis is on ensuring that a JPC is ordered into it so that he harvests its yield in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Presently, the BJP seems to have smelt the Congress gameplan. Hence, both Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and BJP president Amit Shah had outrightly rejected any JPC probe. The tug of war over JPC on Rafale deal would be interesting in the days to come.\n",

      " NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court refused to order an investigation of the Rafale deal , citing the inherent limitations of its power to undertake a judicial review of “sensitive” defence contracts and its lack of expertise in scrutinising pricing or technical feasibility. The move was welcomed by the government and condemned by its critics.The bench led by chief justice of India Ranjan Gogoi dismissed pleas to order a probe into corruption allegations by former ministers Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie among others.“We are satisfied that there is no occasion to really doubt the process, and even if minor deviations have occurred that would not result in either setting aside the contract or requiring a detailed scrutiny by the court,” the bench said. “We find no reason for any intervention on the sensitive issue of purchase of 36 defence aircraft…. Perception of individuals cannot be the basis of a fishing and roving enquiry by this court, especially in such matters.”The petitioners alleged that the government had pulled a 2001deal to buy 126 jets at a lower price only to conclude a fresh deal in 2015 to buy 36 jets at a higher price. The government disputed this claim, saying the cost escalation was on account of add-ons in terms of avionics and armaments.The petitioners alleged a conspiracy at the highest level to defraud the exchequer and favour the Anil Ambani group chosen as offset partner by French aviation company Dassault, which makes the Rafale. Congress president Rahul Gandhi had made the Rafale deal his main point of attack related to corruption against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP ahead of the recent assembly polls, which saw the Congress beating its rival in three states.Sinha, Shourie and the other petitioners said they were disappointed that the court had taken a “conservative view of judicial review” in cases alleging corruption in defence deals involving high functionaries.The petitioners were “shocked the judgment is based on completely false information about the CAG (Comptroller and Auditor General) report: No CAG report on Rafale has been submitted or examined,” they said in a joint statement. They were also “shocked that court accepts Mukesh Ambani’s RIL as ‘parent company’ of Anil Ambani’s Reliance Defence.” They said fresh disclosures are expected soon.The other members of the bench, justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and KM Joseph, gave a concurring judgement. The court rejected all objections to three aspects of the deal — decision-making, prices and the India offset partner.It also rejected a plea that the inter-government agreement (IGA) had been invoked out of turn. The court said that it was informed that joint exercises had taken place, and that there was a financial advantage to the nation. The court said defence procurement contracts should be subject to a different degree of scrutiny.The processes have been broadly followed, it said. “The need for the aircraft is not in doubt,” it said. “The quality of the aircraft is not in question.”Long-drawn negotiations for the procurement of 126 jets had not produced any result. Besides, the court noted that it cannot sit in judgment over the wisdom of deciding to go in for the purchase of 36 aircraft in place of 126. “We cannot possibly compel the government to go in for purchase of 126 aircraft,” it said. “Our country cannot afford to be unprepared/underprepared in a situation where our adversaries… have acquired not only fourth generation, but even fifth generation aircrafts, of which we have none. It will not be correct to sit as an appellate authority to scrutinise each aspect of the process of acquisition.”The court said it had “examined closely the price details and comparison of prices of the basic aircraft along with escalation costs as under original RFP (request for proposal) as well as under the IGA. We have also gone through the explanatory note on the costing, item wise.”The government, the court noted, claimed that there was a commercial advantage in the purchase of 36 Rafale aircrafts apart from a better maintenance and weapon package. “It is certainly not the job of this court to carry out a comparison of the pricing details in matters like the present,” it said.On the choice of the Indian offset partner, which triggered the litigation, the court said that the ‘Clarification on Offset Policy’, posted on September 22 makes it clear that the government has no role in it. “Such matter is seemingly left to the commercial decision of Dassault,” the bench said.As for the role of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), the court said that the government had argued that Dassault was “circumspect” about the stateowned company being able to carry out its contractual obligations and this was responsible for the earlier deal not being wrapped up. “Once again, it is neither appropriate nor within the experience of this court to step into this arena of what is technically feasible or not,” the bench said.\n",

      " The Congress Party under the leadership of Rahul is on meltdown mode. People from all walks of life are fed up with his eternal press conferences about the Rafale deal and the effort he is putting into bringing the BJP down without offering one single point on what he would do as the Prime Minister of India.\n",
      "368 \n",
      " Today, I watched a number of YouTube channels that are not on the mainstream media and they were from Bengal to Uttar Pradesh including many states in between. I realized one thing from the various short interviews of Indians from the Kumbh Mela to various states in India, that Rahul’s constant attack on the Prime Minister is just not working.\n",
      "369 \n",
      " Indians are just not buying it. They hate his press conferences on a single issue; they dislike the fact that he lies; and most of all they feel that the Congress is trying devious ways to attack PM Modi, including a pretty desperate attack on Electronic Voting Machines,  (EVMs) in London, where a Congress Minister, Kapil Sibal was present, with a pretty shady guy from New York, who allowed himself to be named but not seen! The whole episode was so steamy that even the Press Association of UK, said they were not involved in it.\n",
      "370 \n",
      " These seem like desperate tactics by desperate people. I predict the Congress Party will come in with even a lower representation in the General Elections. Notwithstanding the American who has been brought in to coach Rahul, the Congress really has lost the connect with the people of India. I just wonder why they would hire an American when the Indian democracy and voter is so different? Just shows how out of touch they are with the voters.\n",

      " I was in Bhopal just a few weeks ago and just about everyone I spoke to from the shopkeepers to taxi drivers, even in places out of Bhopal, told me that the BJP had turned Madhya Pradesh around. There was no road before connecting the airport to the city; driving at night from Bhopal to Indore before was something you did at your own risk. Today the state is safe, infrastructure such as highways, electricity and water are taken for granted. When I asked them why BJP had lost, they said it was by a very small margin and that too because the Congress had offered the farmers a big loan waiver. This they predicted would never happen to the tune of what was promised. Just a month later it seems to have come true.\n",

The roads to the Bhimbetka caves and Sanchi were great as well as the government tourist lodges where one got freshly cooked good food and clean toilets. Coming back to the 2019 elections and my surfing news and YouTube about real-time data on what the ordinary Indians will vote for, one striking reply by an old voter when asked why he would not vote for Rahul Gandhi was: “If Rahul is the head of the Congress Party, and is so sure of his party’s appeal, why does he have to form an alliance with others why can’t he fight and win on his own?”\n",

Having lived in the US for 15 years, I am proud to say that our citizens not only cherish their right to vote but do it with great acumen. The Indian voter is not fooled by regional parties coming together. The voters interviewed, young and old, men and women had the same view, “Modi has worked and delivered, the other parties only want to stay in power because they are in themselves dynasties, promoting their sons, daughters, or nieces and nephews. They kept promising us things would be better for us but delivered nothing. This time their grand plan is to get rid of Modi, nothing more.”\n",

      " Maintaining that there was massive corruption in the Rafale deal, Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday fired a broadside at the Centre after it rejected the demand for a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe following the Supreme Court verdict rejecting pleas for a probe into the defence deal. Reiterating the Congress’ demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the fighter jet deal, Gandhi claimed that if it was conducted, names of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and businessman Anil Ambani will come to the fore.\n",

      " “The day this matter is investigated, two names will surface. Anil Ambani and Narendra Modi. I have said it earlier and I am saying it now, chowkidar chor hai (the guard is the thief),” he said in a combative presser. The Congress chief also wondered why the CAG report “cited by the Supreme Court” on it had not yet been shared with the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament. “As per the Govt’s statement in the SC, pricing details have been shared with CAG and with the Public Accounts Committee. Mr. Kharge is chairman of PAC and he says, no such report regarding pricing was submitted,” Gandhi said.\n",
      "376 \n",
      " “If a report is submitted to PAC, then it must submit it to the Parliament and then put in the public domain, which has not happened,” said Kharge, the opposition leader in Lok Sabha. Gandhi further said it was not clear how Anil Ambani’s company replaced HAL as the offset partner. “Our questions are simple. Why was Rs 526Cr aircraft bought at Rs 1600Cr? Why was contract taken away from HAL and given to Anil Ambani? HAL is experienced and owns the land,” said the Congress president.\n",
      "377 \n",
      " Both government and Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group have categorically rejected Gandhi’s allegations of any wrongdoing. Gandhi’s reaction came hours after Union Finance Minister termed the opposition’s allegations on the Rafale deal as “fiction writing” and that it compromised national security. Jaitley said every figure cited by Gandhi in his allegations has been false. He said the government would again press for a debate on the issue in Parliament.\n",
      "378 \n",
      " On Congress’ demand for a JPC probe into the deal, Jaitley said only judicial body can carry out such an investigation as there has been experience in the past of JPCs working on partisan lines. The SC verdict is conclusive and leaves no scope of any doubt on the deal, he said.\n",
      "379 \n",
      " The Congress said the apex court has clearly stated that it is outside their jurisdiction to probe the Rafale deal. Party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said his party had said the top court cannot decide the Rafale issue and the alleged corruption in the defence contract can be brought out only by a Joint Parliamentary Committee.\n",

      " Welcoming the court’s decision, Dassault Aviation said it is dedicated to establishing successfully ‘Make in India’ as promoted by PM Modi. “Dassault Aviation will ensure successful production in India through Dassault Reliance Joint Venture in Nagpur as well as through a full-fledged supply chain network,” it said in a statement. In a relief to the Modi government, the Supreme Court earlier in the day dismissed the pleas challenging the deal between India and France for procurement of 36 Rafale jets, saying there was no occasion to “really doubt the decision making process” warranting setting aside of the contract.\n",
      "381 \n",
      " The apex court rejected the pleas which sought lodging of an FIR and a court-monitored probe alleging irregularities in the Rs 58,000 crore deal, in which both the countries have entered into an inter-governmental agreement.\n",

      " The Rafale deal has been the subject of heated claims and counter-claims on two broad issues — that the contract to purchase 36 French multi-role fighter aircraft was grossly overvalued and that it was tainted by crony capitalism. Ammunition for the second charge came from an unexpected quarter with former French President François Hollande stating in an interview that it was India that suggested the Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Defence Ltd. as the offset partner for the deal. This squarely contradicts what the Modi government has been saying all along. While the Centre has insisted that the choice of offset partners is entirely that of the manufacturer, or of Dassault Aviation, Mr. Hollande’s remarks were widely perceived as bolstering the Congress allegation that the Rafale deal was structured to favour one industrialist. In the storm that ensued, the clarificatory statements issued — by the Centre, the French Foreign Ministry and Dassault — did little to clearly address what Mr. Hollande had said. The Defence Ministry’s statement merely reiterated that governments have no role in offset contracts, which are purely commercial. The French government said pretty much the same thing, and Dassault’s statement reaffirmed that it had chosen to tie up with Reliance Defence. But all this merely begs the question: did the Centre suggest a partnership with Reliance Defence as Mr. Hollande said? Also, if so, what form did it take? A firm nudge in that direction? A quiet whisper in someone’s ear? Who suggested to who? And when? It remains to be seen whether Mr. Hollande will now choose to complete his half-finished remarks to the French investigative website.\n",
      "383 \n",
      " No questions have been raised about the capabilities of the Rafale jet, and the corruption allegations have persisted in the absence — unlike in the case of some other defence deals such as Bofors — of a financial trail. But a fair part of the reason for the concerns about the deal relate to process. If it was the temptation to make a headline-grabbing announcement that led Prime Minister Modi to unexpectedly announce the decision to purchase 36 Rafale aircraft, during his France visit in April 2015, it was a bad mistake. It is true that the deal was signed only in September 2016, after clearance from the Cabinet Committee on Security, but Mr. Modi’s 2015 declaration of a new deal clearly caught even many of his senior officials unawares, who were labouring under the belief that negotiations for the purchase of 126 Rafale aircraft, initiated by the UPA government, were still on. As things stand, greater transparency is the only way to clear the air. Private briefings to Opposition leaders and the disclosure of all information that doesn’t jeopardise national security or impact the aircrafts’ operational capability are good starting points. The decision to reject the formation of a Joint Parliamentary Committee to examine the deal should be reconsidered. If the political war over Rafale continues, it is defence modernisation that will become the real victim.\n",

      " Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Monday claimed that an audio clip related to the Rafale deal released earlier this month was authentic and that Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar was in possession of “explosive Rafale secrets”.

      "386 \n",
      " However, both Rane and Parrikar had claimed that the clip was inauthentic and doctored. Gandhi, while citing an ANI tweet from January 2 quoting Rane, said it had been 30 days since the “Goa Audio Tapes” on Rafale were released. “No FIR or enquiry ordered,” Gandhi tweeted. “No action against the minister [Rane] either! It’s obvious that the tapes are authentic [and] that Goa CM, Parrikar, is in possession of explosive Rafale secrets, that give him power over the PM.”\n",

      " He is heard claiming that Parrikar had said that he had in his possession “each and every document of Rafale”.

In 2015, the government had entered into a deal with France for purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets. However, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has time and again accused the government of buying the planes at a higher price than what the UPA-II had negotiated.\n",
      "420 \n",
      " In an exclusive interview to news agency ANI, Jaitley today said that Congress had recently made false allegations against the Modi government. \"Mr Rahul Gandhi himself has given seven different prices in different speeches with regard to the Rafale, that is the 2007 offer,\" he said. \"What was negotiated from 2015 to 2016 and finally executed in 2016, with the escalations and the currency variations, the basic aircraft price turns out to be 9 per cent cheaper. Is the Congress party aware of this?\" the Finance Minister further asked.\n",

He said: \"Are they (Congress) aware of this fact or have their ministers who dealt with it and know the file, told them that if it was a fully weaponised loaded aircraft? Loaded to unloaded, you compare the price again. The 2016 price is 20 per cent cheaper than the 2007 offer. So we got it cheaper.\"\n",

Justifying the deal between the Indian and French governments, Jaitley said that any responsible politician will know that government to government transactions are always clean. \"Governments don't pay kickbacks.

The Government will purchase 36 fully-loaded aircraft coming all the way from France, manufactured in France, no private party involved. The Government of India's role ends.\"\n",
      "424 \n",

Who will he make purchases from? He selects his own partners. Those purchases have nothing to do with Rafale or these aircraft. He could be buying guns, pistols, binoculars or some spare parts.

Modi has looted the nation and an industrialist close to him has pocketed the loot, alleged Dev who is campaigning against the deal throughout the country.\n",
      "427 \n",
      " \"The Rafale deal is a copy book case of squandering national interests, causing loss to public exchequer and promoting the culture of crony capitalism at the cost of Public Sector Undertaking (PSU),\" Dev, also an MP, claimed in a press conference here. She alleged that the Rafale deal as \"the biggest scam in the history of India\" and \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi as its principle agent\".\n",

      " The Congress has repeatedly alleged a \"scam\" in the purchase of Rafale fighter jets claiming the cost per aircraft in 2012 during the UPA regime was agreed at Rs 526.10 crore while the one signed by the Modi government costs Euro 7.5 billion (Rs 1,670.70 crore per aircraft). At that time the aircraft would have been manufactured by the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, a PSU, but now the defence offset contract went to a private company with zero experience of manufacturing fighter aircrafts, the party claimed.\n",

      " Less than a week after the government had asked the Supreme Court for a correction in its order on the Rafale jet fighter deal, the Congress has continued to keep up the pressure on the government. “We want a JPC as we’ll only get to know everything when Parliament members sit and look into the files. A JPC was formed in Bofors and 2G cases also. How can there be a typo? Had it been one word it would’ve been understandable, entire paragraph can’t be a typo,” Congress Lok Sabha floor leader Mallikarjun Kharge told ANI on Wednesday.\n",
      "431 \n",
      " Last Saturday, the defence ministry had filed an application before the Supreme Court for the correction of a paragraph in its order on the Rafale jet fighter deal. Though the court’s ruling effectively vindicated the government’s stand that due process had been followed in reaching the Rs 59,000 crore deal, and had said that there was no reason to order a probe by the CBI.\n",
      "432 \n",
      " However, the Congress pointed out that the judgment had referred to the government’s stand that the pricing details had been shared with the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, and that the government auditor had submitted a redacted report to parliament. It also indicated that parliament’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) had examined the report.\n",
      "433 \n",
      " That error had been picked up by the petitioners and the opposition which had claimed that the government had misled the court with its original submission. “How does the Supreme Court judgment have this line that Rafale pricing has been examined by the PAC. Now, we have to ask the government, where is this CAG report?” Congress president Rahul Gandhi had said at that time.\n",
      "434 \n",
      " The original paragraph in the order (paragraph 25) said: “The pricing details have, however, been shared with the Comptroller and Auditor General (hereinafter referred to as CAG), and the report of the CAG has been examined by the Public Accounts Committee… Only a redacted portion ...was placed before the Parliament and is in public domain.”\n",
      "435 \n",
      " In its submission asking for a correction, the defence ministry had said that the court seems to have misunderstood it, which was, it added, “in the form of bullet points”. According to the ministry, the “second bullet point” read: “The Government has already shared the pricing details with the CAG. The report of the CAG is examined by the PAC. Only a redacted version of the report is placed before the Parliament and in public domain”.\n",
      "436 \n",
      " The petition had argued that the use of the word “is” was “a description of the procedure usually followed” and asked the court to replace “has been” in paragraph 25, which seems to suggest that the act has already taken place, with “is”. Ideally, of course, the government’s original submission should have used “will be” instead of “is” to make things clear.\n",
      "437 \n",
      " “They have given wrong information to the court and on the basis of that information, the court has given its verdict. Now, I will request all the PAC panel members to fix a meeting to summon the attorney general and the Comptroller and Auditor General. We want to ask them when did they submit the Rafale report to the House and when did it come to the PAC, when did they come to give evidence, and when did we present the PAC report to Parliament?” Kharge had said on Saturday.\n",
      "438 \n",
      " Responding to Congress’ allegations of misleading the court and over which the party has been stalling the functioning of Parliament, Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said at that time that the error was a technicality. “He is going into technicality, I am going on substance. The court verdict is in 34 para(graph)s. It has dealt with all the issues (raised by Rahul). If he (Rahul) wants to find faults to do politics, I have nothing to say,” Prasad had said.\n",

      " The Rafale deal struck by the Narendra Modi government was not \"was not on better terms than the offer made by Dassault Aviation to the UPA government for 126 Rafale jets\", The Hindu reported. The Hindu has released another report, third one in less than a week, over the controversial Rafale deal. According to key findings of the three domain experts on the Indian Negotiating Team, the new Rafale deal for 36 ready-to-fly aircraft signed by the BJP-led NDA government is not better than the previous UPA government.\n",
      "441 \n",
      " The report further mentioned that the delivery schedule of the first 18 of the 36 flyaway Rafale aircraft in the new deal was slower than the one offered for the 18 flyaway aircraft in the original procurement process. The findings of the team, The Hindu reported, are contradicting to the claims made by the Central government saying that the deal struck by the BJP-led NDA government was cheaper, and delivery of the aircraft was faster (compared to UPA deal) and these assertions were even submitted to the Supreme Court of India.\n",

      " MP Singh, Adviser (Cost), a Joint Secretary-level officer from the Indian Cost Accounts Service; AR Sule, Financial Manager (Air); and Rajeev Verma, Joint Secretary & Acquisitions Manager (Air) are the three domain experts who noted their assertions in a \"strong dissent note\" dated 1 June, 2016. A series of investigative articles have rocked the political circle in India as the Opposition parties, mainly Congress, has upped the attack against the ruling BJP over irregularities in the Rafale deal.  Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections 2019, where the ruling NDA alliance led by the Bharatiya Janata Party will be fighting to win another mandate at the Centre, the controversy around the Rafale deal has exploded to huge proportions.\n",
      "443 \n",
      " The findings of the team acquire significance because these were the arguments presented to the Supreme Court by the NDA government citing why the Rafale deal signed under the current political dispensation is better off than the earlier agreement. The benchmark price — a number discovered in advance by financial experts which acts as a ceiling on the finally negotiated price of the whole package — for the aircraft and its weapons combined was originally fixed at €5.06 billion, but it ultimately shot up to €7.87 billion — an escalation by 55.6 percent above the benchmark. The Hindu reported: \"It is highlighted that the initial commercial offer from the French side was for firm and fixed price which was converted to price based on escalation formula during the price negotiations. The benchmark price prepared by INT was for firm and fixed price and not adjusted to price based on escalation formula. The final price offered by the French Government (which is escalation based) is 55.6% above the benchmark (which is for firm and fixed price). Considering the future escalations till the time of delivery, the gap in the benchmark and the final price would further increase. Minor adjustments towards costs of Technical Publications, Advance Training of IAF Pilots and Technicians and Role Equipment would not make much dent to this huge gap.\"\n",
      "444 \n",
      " Earlier reports in The Hindu sparked a fresh debate over the Rafale deal as the report quoted a 2014 note written by the Ministry of Defence which raised strong objections to 'parallel negotiations' conducted by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) with the French side. Stating that it was clear that such parallel discussions by the PMO had \"weakened the negotiating position of MoD and Indian Negotiating Team,\" the note, dated 24 November, 2015 brought this to the attention of the then defence minister Manohar Parrikar.\n",
      "445 \n",
      " The second report in The Hindu claimed that the deal involved \"major and unprecedented concessions from the Indian government, with critical provisions for anti-corruption penalties and making payments through an escrow account dropped days before the signing of the inter-governmental agreement (IGA).\" The Modi government, which rode to power in 2014 on the promise of culling corruption out of the country, came under intense criticism after the report was released on 11 February.\n",

      " The Indian Express, in its report, said that in March 2015 before Modi announced officially procuring the 36 Rafale jets from France, industrialist Anil Ambani reportedly visited the then French defence minister's office in Paris and had a meeting with his top advisors. Special advisor to the then defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian met Ambani with industry advisor, Christophe Salomon; and his technical advisor for industrial affairs, Geoffrey Bouquot. Ambani’s meeting was described by Salomon to a top official of a European defence company as 'confidential and planned as you can imagine with very short notice'.\n",

Gandhi later left for Kerala to address Congress’s booth level workers in Kochi. Reacting to the visit, BJP leader and the Goa assembly deputy speaker, Michael Lobo, called Gandhi a “tall leader” who had set politics aside to call on the chief minister. “Simple and humble leaders are difficult to find in India and across the world and here it is Rahul Gandhi who has come on a private visit to Goa, made it a point to come and visit Manohar-ji, ex defence minister, to inquire about his health,” Lobo said.\n",

Rahul Gandhi’s remark came as reaction to Rane’s rebuttal of the allegation in the audio tape. Rane said, “The audio tape is doctored. The Congress has stooped to such a low level to doctor a tape to create miscommunication between cabinet and the chief minister. Mr Parrikar has never made any reference to Rafale or any documents.

The Congress has also claimed that the deal was changed to benefit Anil Ambani, whose Reliance Defence is an offset partner of Dassault Aviation.

Here’s a comprehensive look at the twists and turns in what the two parties have said on the issue over the last three years. The Congress slammed the Modi government for compromising national security and alleged that a huge scam was brewing in the procurement of Rafale fighter aircraft for the Indian Air Force. The Congress said that the Modi government signed the Rafale deal on September 23, 2016, for the purchase of 36 Rafale fighter aircraft from Dassault for approximately Rs 58,000 crore and on October 3, Reliance Defence Limited, owned by Anil Ambani, tied up with the French company for a Joint venture for defence production in India. The Congress cited a Reliance document to point out that off-sets in the deal, which are half the cost of 36 aircraft, work out to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore. “That means the deal is worth Rs 60,000 crore,” said Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, adding the government did not part with any information related to the deal despite several attempts by his party. Non-transparency in the deal also denied the transfer of technology to the public sector Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, the Congress further said.\n",
      "486 \n",
      " \"Dear RM, what's shameful is your boss silencing you. Please tell us: 2. Did PM take CCS permission before announcing purchase in Paris? 3. Why PM bypassed experienced HAL and gave the deal to AA rated businessman with no defence experience?\" Rahul tweeted. Rahul Gandhi, at a poll rally in Gujarat said, \"I would ask Modiji three questions (on the Rafale deal). First, is there a difference in the cost of planes in the first and the second contract (signed with a French firm) and did India pay more or less money as per the second contract? And, has the industrialist (whose company has formed a joint venture with the French firm), who was given the contract, ever manufactured planes?\" Further, he said, “And a more important question, did you follow the due government procedure? Why the (then) defence minister (Manohar Parrikar) was seen catching fish in Goa? And, was an approval from the Cabinet Committee on Security taken (for the mega deal)? Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley hit back at Rahul, saying unlike during Congress regimes when middlemen ruled the roost, there was no “Quattrocchi\" in the contract for the Rafale fighter jet. Jaitley was referring to Ottavio Quattrocchi, the Italian businessman believed to be involved in the Bofors scam which came to light when Rajiv Gandhi was the Prime Minister.\n",
      "487 \n",
      " RM says the price negotiated for each RAFALE jet by the PM and his “reliable” buddy is a state secret. Action Points: 1.Informing Parliament about the price is a national security threat, 2.Brand all who ask, Anti National.” Congress president Rahul Gandhi accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of protecting those behind alleged corruption in the Rafale deal. He noted that it is for the first time that the Defence Minister is saying \"we will not tell the country\". \"This is the biggest deal for the backbone of the Air Force, but Defence Minister says we will not tell the country as it is a secret, under a deal struck in Paris\". Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma also alleged there was a big scam in the Rafale deal as the price at which the planes were negotiated were four times higher and benefitted private firms. The Centre then came out with a detailed statement rebutting Congress’ allegations. The Modi administration said the current deal “is better in terms of capability, price, equipment, delivery, maintenance, training, etc than that notionally negotiated by the then government (UPA II) in a process it could not conclude in ten years”.\n",

On the other hand, defence ministry sources claimed that the original deal to procure 126 Rafale fighter jets could not go through during the UPA rule despite reaching the final stage as the then Defence Minister A K Antony felt there was something wrong in the process and asked for a review. At a Karnataka election rally, Rahul Gandhi however, intensifying his attack on the Centre over the Rafale fighter jet deal, alleged it was the biggest issue of corruption in the country and asked the prime minister to reply why he took the contract from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and gave it to a \"friend\".\n",

Intriguingly, Reliance Aerostructure Ltd. was given the licence to manufacture fighter aircraft by the Defence Ministry but it did not own any land or building on the date of the licence, which is 22nd February, 2016,\" said Congress leader Randeep Surjewala.\n",

      " Congress president Rahul Gandhi kicked off the party’s Lok Sabha election campaign in Karnataka on Monday by challenging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a debate on the Rafale aircraft deal, accusing the government of compromising national interest. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party responded swiftly,terming the allegation “reckless and baseless.” Speaking at a Janadhwani (people’s voice) rally in Bidar, in northern Karnataka, to mark the start of the campaign for the 2019 polls, Gandhi said he would like “a debate [to] happen between me and Narendra Modi on Rafael deal... I will speak at length for hours.”\n",
      "494 \n",
      " Gandhi has on several occasions alleged wrongdoing -- which the government has denied -- in the deal to purchase 36 Rafale military aircraft made by the French company Dassault. The deal followed an earlier proposal -- now scrapped -- by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government for the purchase of 136 Rafale planes.\n",
      "495 \n",
      " “I spoke about the Rafale deal in Parliament… The United Progressive Alliance wanted lakhs of Indian youth to get jobs through the deal and so it was given to the public sector, with clauses for technology transfer as well,” Gandhi said. “Under the UPA deal, 136 aircraft were to be purchased, each one costing Rs 526 crore. But the Modi government changed this and now only 36 planes will be bought at Rs 1,600 crore per aircraft and without technology transfer,” Gandhi said.\n",
      "496 \n",
      " In New Delhi, the BJP dismissed Gandhi’s criticism of the Rafale deal as desperation because of an income tax investigation against a company in which he and his mother Sonia Gandhi are majority stakeholders. The ruling party reiterated that the deal was “transparent” and “honestly executed” between two heads of government.\n",
      "497 \n",
      " “Rahul Gandhi is not worth to have a debate with the prime minister,” senior BJP leader and Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said. “He had said there will be earthquake if he speaks for 15 minutes in Parliament. He spoke (in the monsoon session) and nothing happened.” The BJP leader said Gandhi was making “reckless and baseless” allegations against the government in desperation because he is in trouble in a tax matter connected with a company, Young Indian, in which he and his mother hold a 76% stake.\n",
      "498 \n",
      " Prasad said tax authorities had opened records related to the assessment year 2011-12, during which the company had taken over properties of Associated Journal Limited (AJL) worth over Rs 5,000 crore for a mere Rs 50 lakh. AJL is owner of the National Herald newspaper. “Let the country know as to how upon a meagre transfer of Rs. 50 lakh, the AICC (All India Congress Committee) transferred the liability of Rs 90 crore to Young Indian...How is it that the entire property of AJL came to be owned by Young Indian? How can you take a party loan into your own company,”\n",
      "499 \n",
      " Tax authorities, in a revised claim for the assessment year 2011-12, will make Young Indian liable to pay Rs 154 crore and not just Rs 68 lakh as tax, Prasad said. He reiterated that the Rafale deal signed under the National Democratic Alliance government was 9% cheaper than the price that the UPA regime had agreed to pay.\n",
      "500 \n",
      " The BJP also released a brief video featuring actor Pallavi Joshi to defend the deal. Joshi is seen in the video drawing an analogy between the purchase of security apparatus in her apartment and the Rafale deal negotiated under the Modi government to draw the conclusion that the latter was cheaper than the price the previous government had agreed to pay; the planes would also come with additional features, she said.\n",
      "501 \n",
      " Gandhi used the rally to ridicule Modi’s recent comment that he had heard of a tea seller using biofuel collected from a drain to fire his stove. The anecdote narrated by Modi, Gandhi said, is an indication that the PM’s new employment strategy is to advise the young to make pakoras for a living and not even provide them with gas to fuel their stoves. He was referring to remarks made by Modi on Friday at the World Biofuels Day in New Delhi.\n",
      "502 \n",
      " “At an innovation conference, the prime minister… (spoke about) a dhabawala whose shop was located near a drain. Modi said this man invented a new technology, wherein he put a pipe to the drain and collected biogas and fired his stove using that,” Gandhi said. “This is Narendra Modi’s new employment strategy for the country. He promised 20 million jobs a year, but now he says make pakoras, and won’t even give you gas, so you have to take it from the drain.”\n",
      "503 \n",
      " The reference is to the Prime Minister saying in a televised interview that even making and selling pakoras to earn Rs 200 a day was a form of employment. Responding to Gandhi’s comments, state BJP spokesperson S Prakash said the Congress president had proved he had little understanding of biofuels. “He clearly does not understand the potential savings biofuels can help bring about by cutting down on consumption of petroleum products. These are highly irresponsible statements that are worrying because Gandhi aspires to become the prime minister,” Prakash added.\n",

      " Three years and six months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that India would buy Rafale fight jets from France, Congress president Rahul Gandhi today demanded his resignation from the post accusing him of corruption. On April 10, 2015, PM Modi had announced Rafale deal in Paris. The deal was officially signed on September 26, 2017.\n",
      "505 \n",
      " The Rafale deal is an agreement between the governments of India and France for procurement of 36 fighter jets in flyaway condition. The decision was taken at the summit level talks between PM Modi and the then President of France Francois Hollande. That Indian Air Force needs upgrade was flagged in post-1999 Kargil War period. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government initiated the process but technical specifications could not be finalised before it was voted out of power in 2004.\n",
      "506 \n",
      " Final proposal for the purchase of 126 fighter jets came from the Indian Air Force in 2007. The new government under Manmohan Singh approved it and a tender was floated. Following a modified bidding process, Dassault Aviation was finalised as the supplier and the fighter jet that was zeroed in on was Rafale fighter. By the time, Rafale was chosen by the Indian Air Force, the second Manmohan Singh government had completed half its term. The Rafale deal could not be signed during the UPA rule.\n",
      "507 \n",
      " Before the Narendra Modi government could be sworn in, a work-share agreement was signed between Dassault Aviation and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in March, 2014. However, the deal hit rough weather after the Modi government came to power in May, 2014. A few months later, Dassault Aviation cited higher manpower cost at HAL and expressed inability to continue with the signing of deal.\n",
      "508 \n",
      " Rafale fighter is a twin-engine combat jet in Medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA). It is manufactured by French aerospace company, Dassault Aviation. Indian Air Force has said that the induction of Rafale fighter jets would help replace aging MiG series fighters of Soviet era. The Rafale deal was signed in January 2016 during President Hollande's visit to India. Some 20 months later, in November 2017, the Congress smelt a rat in the Rafale deal saying a \"huge scam is brewing\". The Congress has upped its ante against the government every time its leaders led by Rahul Gandhi picked up this issue.\n",
      "509 \n",
      " The Rafale debate saw frequent disruptions during the Budget Session and Monsoon Session of Parliament this year. Rahul Gandhi alleged that the BJP was not allowing Parliament to run in order to prevent him from speaking on the Rafale deal. Rahul Gandhi said that if he was allowed to speak on Rafale deal in Parliament, there would be an \"earthquake\". Finally, Rahul Gandhi spoke during the Monsoon Session and alleged that PM Modi was directly involved in Rafale scam.\n",
      "510 \n",
      " In between came out reports saying that the government ensured that industrialist Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence was made an off-set partner of Dassault Aviation as mandated by the India-France government-to-government agreement. The BJP and the Modi government denied the charge. The Reliance Defence also refuted the allegation saying the arrangement with Dassault predates signing of India-France agreement. Dassault Aviation said that it chose Reliance as partner on its own.\n",
      "511 \n",
      " The Congress alleged that the Modi government signed the contract with France at a much higher price than negotiated during the UPA rule. Rahul Gandhi and other Opposition leaders demanded that the government must reveal the price of Rafale. The government rejected the demand saying that the price disclosure is covered under the secrecy clause of the deal.\n",
      "512 \n",
      " Rahul Gandhi, on the other hand, has claimed to have been told \"personally\" by former French President Francois Hollande that the Modi government could reveal the price of Rafale without jeopardising the defence deal.

      "554 \n",
      " Rahul also claimed that the BJP has done “step motherly treatment towards Amethi.” “My plan is to make Amethi the education centre of the country,” he said. Rahul has been representing Amethi Lok Sabha constituency in Parliament since 2004. This is the fourth time he will be contesting from the seat.\n",
      "555 \n",
      " Further attacking the Prime Minister, Rahul said: “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has waived off loans worth Rs 5,55,000 crore of 15 people. This means money was stolen from people’s pockets and given to Mehul Choksi, Neerav Modi, Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi and Anil Ambani… But when farmers ask to waive off their loans, then the Prime Minister says I won’t do it”.\n",
      "556 \n",
      " He added, “‘Chowkidar’ din bhar jhoot bolta hai. Usne paanch saal Hindustan ka time zaya kiya (‘Chowkidar’ keeps lying the whole day. He has only wasted the country's time for the past five years). “Pehle 100 din dete they na, iss baar 150 din denge. Jo inhone garibo se cheena, kisano se, mazduro se, yuvao se cheena, uska dugna mein Anil Ambani jaise choro se cheenkar yaha dalunga,” he said. (ANI)\n",

      " Several documents were stolen in the break-in at the Indian Air Force (IAF) Rafale Project Management Team office in France last week, according to defence sources. However, a crucial hard disk was left behind by the culprits, who accessed three rooms. “There were documents, disks with information and a crucial hard disk. The hard disk is intact,” a defence source told The Hindu. But it is unclear if the hard disk was accessed by the culprits, the source added.\n",
      "558 \n",
      " The PMT, consisting of four IAF officers and headed by a Group Captain, is overseeing the implementation of the €7.87 billion Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) for 36 Rafale multi-role jets in fly-away condition. The office is located within the premises of French aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation in the suburbs of Paris.\n",
      "559 \n",
      " The exact nature of the missing documents is yet to be determined, the source said. However, the IAF has identified the likely information that would have been leaked from the nature of the documents taken. They may be related to supply protocols, routine communications and weapons-related details but do not include price, another source said.\n",
      "560 \n",
      " The local police have registered a case and are investigating the matter. At least two other break-ins were reported on the premises, but it is not yet known if they are related. A third source said the crime was very well planned and the culprits came prepared. As per the 2016 Inter Government Agreement (IGA) , the first Rafale fighter is scheduled to be delivered to the IAF in September 2019 with the entire set of 36 jets coming in by 2022.\n",
      "561 \n",
      " In a similar incident in 2016, 22,400 documents containing technical details of the Scorpene conventional submarines being built in India under technology transfer from Naval Group of France were leaked. They were later published by the media outlet The Australian. The Defence Ministry had then stated that the details were leaked from outside the country. Reports later said they were leaked by a former French officer working with Naval Group.\n",
      "562 \n",
      " In its final written submissions to the Supreme Court, the Centre has reiterated that no grounds are made out for a review of the December, 2018 decision of the court giving it a clean-chit in the Rafale controversy in view of \"the application filed by the petitioners themselves, wherein the production of number of documents has been prayed for, (which) clearly establishes that the petitioners are trying to get a fishing enquiry directed without even laying foundation of a prima facie case\".\n",
      "563 \n",
      "  It is submitted that in the garb of seeking review, reliance is being placed on some press reports and some incomplete internal file notings, obtained unauthorisedly and illegally from the Defence Ministry, in an attempt to get a fishing and roving enquiry ordered.    Moreover, it is argued that the CAG report, which has \"comprehensively dealt with all technical and commercial matters including the pricing of the basic aircraft, the pricing of the entire package including the aircraft package and weapons package, bench-marking of price, price advantage due to shift from firm and fixed price to non-firm and fixed price, the cost of Bank Guarantees, lower prices negotiated for India Specific Enhancements and the delivery timelines amongst other issues\", has been given the go-by by the petitioners.\n",
      "564 \n",
      " The government has sought to rebut every claim levelled in the review pleas in the light of this CAG report, the credibility of which was attacked by petitioner-in-person Prashant Bhushan in the hearing on May 10-   \"how did they know in November that in the report submitted in February, the pricing would be redacted? In its 'dissent note' at the start of the audit report, the CAG says that a request was received in January to redact the commercial details but the CAG was reluctant to carry out the redaction on account of lack of precedence! But when the Defence Ministry reiterated the request citing national security concerns, the details were eventually redacted...And now the government says that the CAG report has come which declares that all is well (in the Rafale deal) and hence, the review plea should be dismissed? How can we rely on this CAG report when the government knew in advance of an unprecedented redaction from it?\", he had urged.\n",
      "565 \n",
      " In context of the objection of three members of the INT to the 'bench mark price' being raised from 5.2 billion to 8.2 billion euros (which was repeatedly stressed by the review petitioners), the observation of the CAG that the benchmark price set by the INT was \"unrealistically low\" as compared to the commercial offer has been highlighted.\n",
      "566 \n",
      "    So far as the redaction of the pricing details from the report as laid down before the Parliament is concerned, it is advanced that there are several past instances of such redactions in respect of weapons, assets, location, numbers, deficiencies, such as in the 2017 report on the induction of Strategic Missile System in S-sector and another of 2014 on the procurement of Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation System.\n",
      "567 \n",
      "   In response to the suspicion surrounding Anil Ambani's RAL being chosen as the IOP in connection with the new deal, it is submitted that the annual offset implementation schedule, as per the offset contract, will commence from October, 2019 and that Dassault is yet to submit a formal proposal indicating the details of IOPs and products for offset discharge, in which the government of India has no role to play.\n",
      "568 \n",
      " \"On offsets, there has been no fundamental change since the judgment of Court delivered on 14.12. 2018 except some media reports suggesting a settlement of tax case of ADAG Group in France. This is a sovereign decision by a foreign country in a sector unrelated to defence which cannot be linked to purchase of 36 Rafale aircraft in any way\", the Centre has suggested.\n",
      "569 \n",
      " As regards the opposition to the doing away of the Bank Guarantee or Sovereign Guarantee for this deal, it is urged that the three dissenting INT members were \"relying on incomplete information which is not even borne out by facts as they have emerged\" in believing that the delivery of the Indian order would commence 10 years hence while 60% of the price would be tendered much before.\n",
      "570 \n",
      "   Further, it is pointed out that the review pleas ignore the \"outstanding guarantee\" offered by the French government in the Letter of Comfort, undertaking to ensure at the earliest the reimbursement of any intermediary payments in the event of difficulty in executing the supply protocols, and the joint and several responsibility as assumed by the French Republic along with Dassault under the IGA.\n",
      "571 \n",
      " Finally, it is stated that the Bank Guarantee charges as calculated by the CAG are around 7 times lower than the estimate of the three members of the Indian Negotiating Team, and that \"even after taking into account that this is a saving by the vendor, the price in 36 Rafale aircraft procurement is lower than the audit aligned price from MMRCA bid\".\n",
      "572 \n",
      " Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said former defence minister Manohar Parrikar \"clearly denied\" any involvement in the new Rafale fighter jet deal \"orchestrated\" by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to \"benefit\" Reliance Group chairman Anil Ambani. A day after tweeting about “explosive Rafale secrets,” Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday visited Goa Assembly and met ailing Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar.\n",
      "573 \n",
      " Speaking to the media, Gandhi said, \"Friends, the ex-defence minister clearly stated that he has nothing to do with the new deal that was orchestrated by Mr Narendra Modi to benefit Anil Ambani.\" The Gandhi scion went on to say that as a result of this \"crime,\" thousands of young Indians all across the country have been kept from getting high paying jobs with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).\n",
      "574 \n",
      " Rahul further attacked the Prime Minister over former French president Francois Hollande's statement last year, wherein he said that the Indian government gave Dassault Aviation no choice but to choose Reliance Aviation as the offset partner. \"I would like to ask you, why did the ex-President of France tell the press clearly that he was told by the Indian Prime Minister to give the Rafale contract to Mr Anil Ambani? I want to ask you, why was the man who has no experience in building an aircraft given a contract that was snatched away from those people who had been building aircraft for 70 years in the country,\" Rahul said.\n",
      "575 \n",
      " He then highlighted that the price inflation of an aircraft from around Rs 500 crore to Rs 1600 crore was done to \"underscore his point of wrongdoings in the deal.\" \"Youngsters of this country, youngsters of Kerala, there is only one answer, the answer is that the Prime Minister of India is corrupt,\" Rahul said.\n",
      "576 \n",
      " The Congress chief continued his tirade against Modi over the unrest in the CBI in recent times, saying that the latter \"was protecting himself when he removes the CBI chief\". The Supreme Court on December 14 last year had dismissed all petitions seeking court-monitored probe into the Rafale deal with France, saying that there was no occasion to doubt the decision-making process in the deal. The top court said it was not its job to go into the issue of pricing.\n",
      "577 \n",
      " The Congress party had, earlier this month, released an audio clip claiming that Parrikar possessed all files related to the deal. Congress party spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala claimed that Goa Health Minister Vishwajit  Rane was speaking in it to another person about the deal. In the audio, Rane, as claimed by Congress, divulged that Parrikar, who was the Defence Minister when the Rafale deal was signed in 2016 between India and France, had \"all files related to the deal in his bedroom.\"\n",
      "578 \n",
      " Later, Rane hit back at the Congress, asserting that the audio tape was doctored and Parrikar made no mention about the Rafale deal or its documents.\n",
      "579 \n",
      " \n",
      "580 \n",
      " Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman of misleading the Lok Sabha on the Rafale deal, the Congress has decided to bring a privilege motion against them. The Congress called it a “scam” and contested the claim that the 2008 inter-governmental agreement between India and France, signed during the UPA regime, does not allow the Government of India to reveal the commercial value of the Rafale deal.\n",
      "581 \n",
      " A formal motion will be moved on Tuesday morning by Mallikarjun Kharge, Jyotiraditya Scindia and K.C. Venugopal. “The motion has to be submitted to the Lok Sabha secretariat before 10 a.m. We will be moving against the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister,” Mr. Venugopal told The Hindu. The final decision on admitting the motion rests with Speaker Sumitra Mahajan.\n",
      "582 \n",
      " The Congress move will be seen as a counter to the BJP having already moved a privilege motion against party chief Rahul Gandhi for making “unsubstantiated allegations” against the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister in his speech during the no-confidence motion debate last Friday. Earlier, former Defence Minister A.K. Antony, along with Deputy Leader of the Congress in the Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma and party communications in-charge Randeep Surjewala, asserted at a press conference that revealing the commercial value of the deal was not covered under any secrecy clause.\n",
      "583 \n",
      " Mr. Sharma also countered Union Minister Arun Jaitley’s charge that the Congress president had “concocted” his conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron on France not having any objection to making the price of the deal public. “Mr. Jaitley was not present there. I was there and know what was said. I take strong objection to the use of the word ‘concocted’ in his blog,” Mr. Sharma said.\n",
      "584 \n",
      " “The scope of the agreement [2008 Agreement] only extends to tactical and technical details of weaponry relating to the capability of the platform in question and its performance and tactics in combat and does not include commercial details and costs. It is clear that the Prime Minister and Defence Minister misled the nation,” Mr. Antony said.\n",
      "585 \n",
      " Mr. Antony said under the law, the government was bound to provide full information to the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defence and the Comptroller and Auditor-General. Mr. Sharma said that in November 2016 and March 2018, the Minister of State for Defence had said the price of an aircraft was ₹670 crore.\n",
      "586 \n",
      " The Congress has argued that under the UPA, the price of a Rafale was ₹526 crore but had increased to ₹1,670 crore under the Modi government. So the BJP needs to explain why the extra ₹41,000 crore is being paid.\n"
