VYes Bank board\u2019s decision to seek extension for Rana Kapoor to stay at the helm is unlikely to be approved by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). "There is no merit in seeking the extension, the bank is just buying more time," said a source close to the developments.\u000a\u000aThis request also raises concerns over corporate governance issues and the role of the board, experts say. They say that the board's actions too should come under scrutiny at a time when the Reserve Bank of India is taking action against chiefs of private sector banks.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis brings to the fore, the role of the board not being played properly. Every board says they have a remuneration and selection committee or policy. They say they have succession planning in place but you still take one year to decide on a successor, which means that (policy) is just a lip service,\u201d said JN Gupta, MD of Stakeholder Empowerment Services.\u000a\u000aOn September 25, the mid-sized lender\u2019s board requested more time from RBI to allow Kapoor to remain as the chief executive officer and managing director (CEO and MD) until a minimum of April 30, 2019 and thereafter extend to September 30, 2019.\u000a\u000aA week ago, the central bank cut short his tenure to January 30 as against the proposed three-year extension.\u000a\u000aAccording to Gupta, the RBI\u2019s denial to give Kapoor a five-month extension must be after taking into account all those factors, \u201cnot that it acted in haste\u201d.\u000a\u000aTime-consuming challenges of finding a suitable successor and to identify and enable a new incumbent to get fully conversant with Yes Bank and its working are the reasons Yes Bank mentioned in its statement to the bourses.\u000a\u000aThe bank also decided to request for a \u201cminimum extension for Kapoor up to April 30, 2019, for finalisation of audited financial statements\u201d.\u000a\u000a"By asking this, the Board admits that 1) They do not have a succession plan; 2) They will take one year to find a new CEO; 3) The argument that Rana Kapoor is required for the finalising of accounts simply cannot be digested," Gupta said.\u000a\u000aIf Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and even Tata Sons could find a replacement in a short time, of course only after RBI's action, why cannot Yes Bank? he asked.\u000a\u000aAround March, the banking regulator raised apprehensions on Axis Bank\u2019s board decision to allow a third reappointment for CEO and MD Shikha Sharma, who will step down in December 31 this year.\u000a\u000aAfter charges of impropriety and conflict of interest were raised against ICICI Bank CEO and MD Chanda Kochhar, the board, which gave a clean chit to her in a day\u2019s time, was reprimanded by the RBI and SEBI.\u000a\u000aThis forced the board to ask Kochhar to go on leave and it created a new position of chief operating officer (COO) handed to Sandeep Bakhshi to look at the business and finance operations of the bank. Bakhshi reports to the board.\u000a\u000aBoth Axis Bank and ICICI Bank took action within four months of the RBI\u2019s directions.\u000a\u000aAccording to another analyst, \u201cThe CEOs want control and they control the board rather than the other way round. The board is a puppet and does not practice any of the corporate governance policies they list out.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo ensure a long-term succession plan, Yes Bank\u2019s board has decided to elevate senior group president Rajat Monga, who handles financial management, and Pralay Mondal, who heads retail, as executive directors.\u000a\u000aMonga, who has been the bank's CFO has also faced questions on approval of the bank's financial statements which misreported NPAs worth Rs 10,531 crore in FY16 and FY17.\u000a\u000aThe analyst quoted above said, this could be Kapoor\u2019s last effort to put his own people in a higher position.\u000a\u000aGlobal brokerage Macquarie Research says that RBI may not approve internal candidates as they may be construed as equally responsible for bank operations, it said. It further added that the stock re-rating now hinges on outcomes of stated action plans as well as FY18 divergences.\u000a\u000aYes Bank\u2019s stock has lost nearly 40 percent since the RBI's action on Kapoor in August end.\u000a\u000aOn the one hand, over 30 brokerages are bullish on the bank from its business and growth perspective, on the other hand, analysts do see near-term challenges faced by the private bank.\u000a\u000aAppointment of a credible new CEO now becomes critical for the stability of Yes Bank\u2019s operations, Macquarie Research adds.\u000a\u000aTo worsen things, given the dispute between Yes bank\u2019s two promoters, both Madhu Kapur (7.2% shareholder) and Rana Kapoor\u2019s (10.66%) approval will be jointly required to appoint a successor.\u000a\u000aThis also raises uncertainty around the strength and stability of the board.
