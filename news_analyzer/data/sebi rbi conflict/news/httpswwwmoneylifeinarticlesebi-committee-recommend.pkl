VSEBI Committee recommends separation of roles for Chairman and MD & CEO, 50% independent directors on board\u000a\u000aThe Uday Kotak Committee set up by SEBI (the third such committee set up by SEBI over the last two decades) has recommended separation of powers of the chairperson or leader of the board) and chief executive and managing director (CEO/MD) or leader of the management, in phased manner to provide a better and more balanced governance structure. The Committee has recommended limiting directorship to a maximum of eight in listed companies. In addition, the Kotak Committee says from 1 April 2019, at least half of the board of directors should comprise of independent directors.\u000a\u000a"After deliberation, the Committee believes that the time is right in India to introduce a separation of the roles of the Chairperson and the CEO/MD for listed entities. The Committee observed that such separation, at least at the stage of introduction of the construct, may be more relevant where public shareholders constitute a large portion of the shareholding of a company. In this regard, the Committee considered various thresholds and concluded at least 40% of public shareholding would be an appropriate threshold. Further, in view of the fact that this would require a significant transition from the existing requirements, the Committee believes that listed entities should be given sufficient time to undertake such a transition," the Report from the Kotak Committee, submitted to SEBI says.\u000a\u000aThe Committee recommended that from 1 April 2020, all listed companies that have public shareholding of 40% or more will have a chairperson, who is non-executive director. Once implemented, this will remain in effect even if the public shareholding of the company falls below the threshold level of 40%. "After 2020, if deemed fit by SEBI," the Committee says, "the above sub-regulation may be modified and from 1 April 2022, chairperson of each listed company would be non-executive director."\u000a\u000aTo improve governance, the Committee recommended that every listed entity, irrespective of whether the Chairperson is executive or non-executive, may be required to have at least half its total number of directors as independent directors. "However, given that this may require significant changes to the composition of the boards, the Committee felt that appropriate transition time should be provided for effecting such change. At least half of the board of directors should comprise of independent directors from 1 April 2019, for the top 500 listed entities, determined on the basis of market capitalisation, as at the end of the immediately preceding financial year; and from 1 April 2020, for all listed entities," the Report says.\u000a\u000aRecommending to limit number of directorships an individual can hold to eight listed companies, the Kotak Committee says, "No person shall hold office as a director, including any alternate directorship, in more than eight listed entities at the same time of which independent directorships shall not exceed seven, with effect from 1 April 2019 and not more than seven listed entities with effect from 1 April 2020 provided that any person who is serving as a whole time director or MD in any listed entity shall serve as an independent director in not more than three listed entities."\u000a\u000aThe Committee says it observed that while aspects relating to the composition and role of the board of directors of listed entities have been subjected to gradual reform, a holistic re-assessment is required to further strengthen the same.\u000a\u000a"Accordingly, this review by the Committee and the attendant recommendations seek to address aspects relating inter-alia to the size of the board and its diversity, separation of the roles of chairperson and executive management, attendance of directors at board meetings, ongoing updation of knowledge of directors and disclosure of their skills or expertise," the Report says.\u000a\u000aHere are other major recommendations of the Committee...
