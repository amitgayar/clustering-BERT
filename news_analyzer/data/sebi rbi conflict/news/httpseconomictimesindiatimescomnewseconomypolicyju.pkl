VTwo hundred years ago, Napoleon Bonaparte said, \u201cMen are powerless to fix the future; institutions alone determine the destinies of nations.\u201dIn the last two years, one of India\u2019s premier institutions, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has seen its credibility take a huge hit. RBI gave up what independence it had when it acquiesced to an ill-conceived demonetisation.Subsequently, under instructions from the government, it stopped revealing the amount of old bank notes being deposited back into the banking system.It finally had to admit under parliamentary questioning that most of the invalidated currency had come back \u2014and the Rs 3.5 trillion windfall the government expected vanished.RBI also bungled the execution of the badly planned demonetisation and, thereby, lost its reputation for competence. Notes were not printed on time; they did not fit the ATMs (automated teller machines) when they were printed, and had to be transported to remote areas under emergency-like conditions. Meanwhile, people and business, especially the micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) and agriculture sectors, suffered hugely. The economic cost was at least 1.5 per cent of GDP, but probably more.But just as RBI was beginning to get back to some semblance of normal functioning \u2014 and dealing with global volatility and domestic banking problems \u2014 it\u2019s now hit again with a demonetisation redux.Rs 3.5 trillion is a magic number. It is the amount the Narendra Modi government failed to get as a bounty from the ill-fated demonetisation. Coincidently, it is approximately what it wants from RBI\u2019s reserves to finance pre-election handouts, and yet, stick to its fiscal targets.It is threatening to invoke the neverbefore-used Article 7 of the RBI Act under which it can direct the central bank in public interest. It is the fundamental reason why the typically non-communicative RBI finally reacted through the emotive public speech by its deputy governor Viral Acharya, on October 26 \u2014 presumably with the approval of governor Urjit Patel There are other differences between RBI and the government: overly strict restrictions against state banks under the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework, insufficient liquidity to the non-bank finance companies (NBFCs), a proposed payments regulator and too tight monetary policy.GoI wants some forbearance for state banks to provide more liquidity to the NBFC sector. It also wants power sector non-performing loans (NPLs) to be treated more leniently. Another bone of contention is the government\u2019s proposal to have a separate payments regulator, taking that function away from RBI \u2014 generally not considered a great idea. In the past, GoI and RBI have had differences on the conduct of monetary policy.RBI, to the government\u2019s pleasant surprise, did not raise rates at its last meeting in October. But it has sold some $40 billion of foreign exchange reserves in the past six months to slow down the rupee\u2019s fall, which has tightened liquidity. RBI is now being pressured to buy unsubscribed government bonds worth Rs 400 billion to lower the government securities (G-Sec) yield.GoI feels RBI was asleep on its watch and allowed excessive lending from the banking system during 2008-14. RBI has responded that it cannot be held responsible for the current banking mess because it does not have the same regulatory powers over state banks that it does over private banks. But its record on supervision is not exemplary.RBI was a principal regulator for Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS), a semi-private financial institution that had to be taken over recently by the government to avoid India\u2019s \u2018Lehman moment\u2019.There is plenty of blame on both sides. But none of these differences would have led to a public breakdown. They form the back and forth between any central bank and government. The main reason for RBI\u2019s intense reaction is the grab for its reserves, which hurts its bottom line directly.In June 2018, RBI had Rs 9.63 trillion of reserves, about 28 per cent of total assets. But two-thirds of these are in a revaluation account that can go up and down. An earlier committee recommended it hold 12 per cent of total assets in reserves. This is the logic that is being made for RBI to transfer around Rs 3.6 trillion to the finance ministry.The idea of using RBI\u2019s \u2018excess\u2019 reserves was raised earlier to pay for the recapitalisation of the state banks. But then, RBI objected and GoI opted for a clever piece of financial engineering. It issued recap bonds worth Rs 1.35 trillion (in a total scheme of Rs 2.11trillion), which were bought by the same state banks that it recapitalised \u2014 increasing the public debt.Whether RBI is finally forced to transfer the \u2018excess\u2019 reserves or not, the public battle has surely damaged the perception of competence of India\u2019s economic team both at North Block and in Mint Street. They should realise that they are tied to each other in a threelegged race in which coordination, not conflict, is the way to win \u2014 especially at a time of massive global volatility.And the Modi government may do well to heed Napoleon\u2019s 200-year-old advice on the need for strong institutions, in India\u2019s economic aspiration to become the world\u2019s third-largest economy.(The writer is visiting scholar, Institute of International Economic Policy, George Washington University, US)
