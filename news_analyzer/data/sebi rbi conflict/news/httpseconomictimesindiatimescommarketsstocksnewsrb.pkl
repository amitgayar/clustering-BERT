VThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in its 83-year history has not made to the front page news as often as it did in first nine months of 2018, facing questions on its credibility and capability. The year started off with bad news. While RBI was still grappling on the NPA front, LoUs (letters of undertaking) issued by PNB brought attention to a PSU bank with simultaneous questions on RBI\u2019s role as a supervisor.While the media was still struggling to find cogent reasons for introducing LoUs as a banking instrument by RBI, controversies around Videocon, ICICI Bank and Chanda Kochhar shifted public glare from the PSU bank to the private bank. Suddenly, Kochhar, the former CEO of ICICI Bank, was in the limelight for alleged governance, transparency, disclosure and conflict-related issues. Soon, another private Bank, Axis Bank , was in the limelight due to tenure-related issues of its CEO, Shikha Sharma Another twist came with the dilution of promoter equity in Kotak Bank, in a perfectly legal manner (as claimed by the bank), but failing in the eyes of critics in the strict sense of the spirit of the law. Soon, RBI showed its teeth and rejected the dilution.RBI once again made to the front-page news with spotlight on IL&FS and Yes Bank. The sudden slide of a stable NBFC into a doubtful-of-survival category was too quick to digest. While the analyst community was still doing number crunching on IL&FS, the regulator passed a diktat curtailing the appointment terms of Yes Bank CEO Rana Kapoor . Soon after, it ordered freezing of Bandhan Bank CEO Chandra Shekhar Ghosh\u2019s salary over failure to stick to shareholding rules.Negative news flow has impacted the share prices of these entities and investor have lost their wealth. Markets are averse to uncertainty and react irrationally. In all the cases cited above, uncertainty still prevails. It appears that while the regulator is entitled to slap you, it may not tell you your mistakes. This lack of transparency is the root cause of disproportionate panic reaction and loss of investors\u2019 wealth. Stakeholders are not aware what went wrong, if any, or what the extent of the wrong was, or whether the wrong is persisting or has been corrected, or who was in the wrong, or whether there was anything wrong at all.It is nobody\u2019s case that RBI has not played its role in creating a robust financial ecosystem and has performed well. But a series of so-called alleged governance/ regulatory failures, without any final enquiry or adjudication, establishes one-sided supremacy of RBI. While there is absolutely no intent to dilute in any manner this supremacy in the best interest of the financial ecosystem, there is a pressing need for the regulator to see the mirror before someone else shows it to them.Is the IL&FS problem an overnight problem or did the regulator fail to see signals? What are the parameters on which RBI chose to show the door to CEOs of Yes Bank and Axis Bank, while keeping mum on ICICI Bank? Why was Bandhan allowed to go ahead with its IPO though Sebi requirements and RBI licence conditions clashed, ensuring that Bandhan will fail one of the regulators? Or, how can it demonstrate that risks can emanate from concentration of ownership in banking system alone and not in NBFCs, where promoters can own any level of equity although banks are more regulated compared to NBFCs?If high promoter equity was an issue, then Axis, ICICI and Yes Bank would not have had any issue of governance? How is the ownership of large equity through diversified non-operating holding company (NOHC) better compared to direct concentrated ownership? When can through minuscule economic risk, disproportionate voting rights be enjoyed by an individual in case of NOHC? How are leveraged political power with low economic risks better? Is higher economic risk by an individual promoter with capped voting rights not better from the governance perspective? Is high promoter stake hindrance to enforcing governance norms? Must governance measures be agnostic to ownership? And if diversified and low promoter equity was panacea of all ills of governance, then why RBI wants IL&FS to have strong shareholders and increase their equity? If higher equity of promoter is bad, then it is bad per se. Catholic Syrian bank is a classic case, where new promoters are allowed 51 per cent equity after earlier promoters followed RBI the diktat on reduction. Should the cycle repeat?RBI needs to put its house in order. Every failure brings an opportunity to rectify past mistakes. RBI needs to revisit its policies, procedure and even redefine objectives. It must constitute a committee of experts, stakeholders and in-house members with a mandate to address issues of governance, ownership, monitoring and reporting with clear cut penalty structure.As any regulatory action has farreaching impact, RBI should hold it horses except in urgent cases where damage is to be contained and controlled immediately. Losses caused by ad hoc actions hurt not only stakeholders but the system as well.(The author is MD of Stakeholders Empowerment Services)
