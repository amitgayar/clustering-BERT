VMUMBAI: The Securities and Exchange Board of India has expressed displeasure over the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s intervention in the trading of HDFC Bank shares after the overseas holding was breached on February 17. Sebi is said to have lodged a protest in a strongly worded letter to RBI.\u201cMarket sanctity is important to Sebi. Even Sebi doesn\u2019t intervene during market hours. RBI can\u2019t do anything like this without consulting with Sebi,\u201d said a regulatory official aware of the letter. \u201cThis is backseat driving.\u201d Sebi has said that to ensure such a situation doesn\u2019t recur a solution needs to be worked out by both regulators.\u201cToday the problem is we don\u2019t have a system to flag the limit has been breached. It is possible to work out a solution and we will create a system to monitor sectoral limits,\u201d the official said.Following the letter, RBI and Sebi officials met to discuss the matter last week, the official said. Queries to RBI and Sebi went unanswered.Some experts said Sebi was right in writing such a letter. \u201cIn an anonymous ordermatching system, the sanctity of trades is critical because millions of investors, whether trading in the stock or not, are impacted by any unnatural intervention,\u201d said Sandeep Parekh , founder, Finsec Law Advisors.\u201cIn the recent example, when foreign investors were asked not to complete executed trades, their counterparts would be innocent investors who are hurt in the process. Even otherwise, there is nothing critical or even important in breaching these limits. These can easily be corrected the next business day by issuing a direction disallowing further purchases till the position is restored,\u201d said Finsec\u2019s Parekh, a former executive director of Sebi.Typically, foreign investment limits are monitored at the end of the day. But on February 17, when the window was opened for fresh purchases in HDFC Bank stock, RBI started collecting the data from stock exchanges, custodians and market participants at frequent intervals.Frenzied buying by foreign portfolio investors in the HDFC Bank stock led to the statutory limit being crossed within a few hours and midway through the trading day, RBI clamped down on them. By then, many trades had already been executed, prompting the central bank to ask all custodians not to settle trades in HDFC Bank made after 1:39 pm on February 17 in which foreigners were buyers.Trades that were not confirmed by the custodians have devolved on the stock brokers that executed the transactions on behalf of foreign clients.\u201cFrom an RBI perspective, it was a damage-control exercise since a delayed notification post the close of market hours would have resulted in more brokers punching in the trades, which later they would have had to take in their own proprietary books,\u201d said Tejesh Chitlangi, partner, IC Legal . \u201cAlso, not to forget that a regulator would be inclined to immediately stop breach of its regulations, once it gets established.\u201d
