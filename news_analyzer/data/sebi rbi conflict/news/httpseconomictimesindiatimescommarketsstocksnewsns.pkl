VMUMBAI: The Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) directed the National Stock Exchange ( NSE ) to pay Rs 687 crore and barred it from accessing the securities market for six months following investigations into the colocation of servers that gave an unfair advantage to some traders.The regulator also banned former NSE chief executives Ravi Narain and Chitra Ramkrishna from associating with any listed company or stock exchange for five years for their alleged role in the matter.The regulator said high-profile academic Ajay Shah was also prohibited from associating in any manner with any stock exchange, depository, market intermediary or listed company for two years. It also barred stock broker OPG Securities and its directors Sanjay Gupta and Sangeeta Gupta from accessing the securities market for five years.The case dates back to 2015, when a whistleblower wrote a letter to Sebi alleging that NSE, India's largest stock exchange, gave preferential access to a few high-frequency traders and brokers to the exchange's trading platform. Sebi named the complainant as Ken Fong.Colocation refers to traders being able to place servers in close proximity to those of an exchange, thus giving them a time advantage that translates into massive profits.Along with interest, the penalty on NSE will likely add up to over Rs 1,000 crore. NSE's reserves and surplus as on March 2018 was Rs 7,225 crore.Narain and Ramkrishna also have to return a fourth of their NSE salary for FY2011-13 and FY14, in that order, corresponding to the years in which they were in charge. All the money will go to Sebi's Investor Protection and Education Fund (IPEF).Ravi Varanasi, head of business development, and Suprabhat Lala, assistant vice president, have been barred from holding any position with any stock exchange for three and two years, respectively."I find that it is established beyond doubt that NSE has not exercised the requisite due diligence while putting in place the TBT (tick-by-tick) architecture," Sebi whole-time member G Mahalingam said in his 104-page order. "The same created a trading environment in which the information dissemination was asymmetric, which cannot be considered fair and equitable."Narain and Ramkrishna held the post of managing director and chief executive officer (MD & CEO) of NSE in succession."Having held the senior-most management position in the NSE and being in charge of the affairs of the conduct of the stock exchange business, they cannot limit their roles to the non-technology issues of the exchange," Sebi said. "The MD and CEO of a stock exchange cannot abdicate his/ her responsibility by citing limited knowledge in certain spheres of the business activities."The regulator dropped allegations of fraudulent and unfair trade practices that it had levelled against the exchange and its employees.Responding to ET\u2019s queries on the development, NSE CEO Vikram Limaye said: "We will take appropriate legal advice on all these matters and then we will take appropriate action."On the exchange\u2019s IPO plans he said: "They have said that we cannot access the markets for six months. The IPO can't happen for six months, but after that obviously the implication of this order is that they will not hold up the IPO. So it is something that we will look into now that we have a final order. Till this point in time, we have a letter from the Sebi that says that we cannot file a DRHP till this matter is resolved."Sebi passed five separate orders on the colocation case against the NSE, OPG Securities, Ajay Shah, Sampark Infotainment and NSE\u2019s corporate governance on Tuesday.The regulator\u2019s main allegation against NSE was that its tick-by-tick system was prone to manipulation, which compromised market fairness and integrity. It allegedly failed to put in place a \u2018randomiser\u2019 that have helped avoid misuse. Sebi also said that NSE failed to implement a load balancer, which put members who were on more crowded ports at a disadvantage and provided an unfair advantage to those on less crowded ones.NSE allegedly did not have defined policies and procedures with regard to secondary server access, and the guidelines were not issued as a circular."By selectively reprimanding some brokers connecting to the secondary servers (and not others), and allowing some brokers to continue connecting regularly to the secondary servers, NSE allegedly showed differential treatment to brokers," the regulator said in its order.The regulator alleged that OPG Securities gained an advantage over other members by consistently connecting to the tick-by-tick servers first."OPG Securities would allegedly regularly connect to the secondary server, and the noticee (NSE) took no action to prevent this despite having knowledge of this," Sebi said.It gained an advantage by hiring an employee of Omnesys Technologies, in which NSE was the second-largest shareholder."OPG used the NSE system to its advantage by (a) hiring Mr Nagbhusan Bhat, who was working with Omnesys to figure out which server was working better; (b) having certain arrangements with NSE\u2019s datacenter staff named Jagdish Joshi who would inform the TM(s) the time when the servers would start, and therefore could be the first to connect; (c) switching on to the fastest servers or accessing least crowded servers with the help of NSE staff members," Sebi said in its background to the case. "It was alleged that OPG indulged in front-running in collaboration with NSE employees."OPG was also allowed to access the backup servers, it said. The management of the NSE was allegedly in denial mode and had not acted on the complaints forwarded to it, Sebi said.The regulator also said Ajay Shah, Infotech Financial Services, Krishna Dagli, Sunita Thomas and Suprabhat Lala were connected persons.Sunita Thomas, who is the director of Infotech, is the wife of Suprabhat Lala of NSE. Ajay Shah is the husband of the sister of Sunita Thomas. Sebi alleged that there was an inherent conflict of interest in NSE in giving the liquidity Index contract to Infotech by overlooking its own subsidiary which is engaged in similar activity.Sebi\u2019s investigation revealed that the trading data that was received by Infotech from NSE for research in the liquidity index project was being misused for developing algorithm trading products."Suprabhat Lala being a senior official of NSE ought to have displayed professional integrity by disclosing to the senior management his connection with Infotech Financial Services through his wife Sunita Thomas which had a strong cause to give rise to a conflict of interest to him as well as to Ajay Shah," the Sebi order said."However, when a data-sharing agreement purely meant for research purposes assumes the colour of a commercial agreement, thereby providing privileged access to confidential and exclusive trade data of the exchange to a select few persons who clandestinely exploit the said data for their commercial gains, it leads to serious issues leading to compromise on market integrity," the regulator said.
