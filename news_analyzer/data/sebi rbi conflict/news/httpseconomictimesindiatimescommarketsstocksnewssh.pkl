VNEW DELHI | MUMBAI: Former economic affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das was named the 25th governor of the Reserve Bank of India to succeed Urjit Patel , who quit abruptly on Monday amid a bitter dispute over the regulator\u2019s autonomy. The appointment means that the central bank will once again be headed by a former Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer. Patel, who had said he was resigning for personal reasons, and his predecessor Raghuram Rajan are economists.The government began the selection process soon after Patel\u2019s resignation. It was expedited as the government didn\u2019t want the post to remain vacant at a crucial juncture. The appointment will be for three years. He is likely to join at the earliest, sources told ET.Das, 63, a veteran Tamil Nadu cadre officer, will first have to work on normalising the relationship between the central bank and the government that had turned frosty in the past few months as the two differed on many issues.Das had been instrumental in establishing the monetary policy committee (MPC) and the switchover to an inflationtargeting regime, among other things. Now that he\u2019s moving to the regulatory side, Das may even have to resist some of the ideas he supported when in government.\u201cThis will ensure continuity in monetary policymaking and regulatory measures even as the global economy is passing through uncertain times.\u201d said Rajnish Kumar , chairman, State Bank of India. \u201cThe financial markets will also significantly benefit given his rich prior experience in fiscal policies and trade. This will also ensure a convergence of domestic and external policies."Welcoming the appointment, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said in a tweet, \u201cExtremely seasoned & matured official with immense experience of finance. He is a brilliant team leader, a great consensus builder & highly communicative. Will focus on India\u2019s economic growth while ensuring RBI\u2019s autonomy.\u201dIndian industry welcomed the appointment and hoped Das would address liquidity concerns. \u201cWe, in industry, are confident that the liquidity squeeze in the banking and non-banking financial sector, which is spilling over into the various segments of industry, would be taken up with all urgency by Das and there would be seamless flow of credit to industry and trade,\u201d said Confederation of Indian Industry president Rakesh Bharti Mittal.Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (Ficci) president Rashesh Shah focused on the need to bring down real interest rates, improve liquidity and promote growth and employment.\u201cImproving credit flow to the real economy, especially in sectors like MSME and housing is critical at this juncture,\u201d he said.The government, which suffered a setback in state election results on Tuesday, will be keen to get cracking on programmes to accelerate economic activity and generate employment ahead of national elections next year. It has been seeking a special liquidity window for non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) that lend to small and medium enterprisesand create jobs in smaller towns. Finance minister Arun Jaitley told ET in an interview on Monday that while overall liquidity may have improved, some sectors still face issues.Das last served as secretary of the department of economic affairs, which means he has invaluable insight into what the government requires. In this role, he was the frontline government spokesman following demonetisation. Also, his interactions with the central bank during those years gives him firsthand knowledge of its functioning.The past few months have seen a battle between the government and the RBI over various issues such as the liquidity crunch that was putting the squeeze on credit, the strict prompt corrective action (PCA) for weak banks and the transfer of excess reserves on the RBI balance sheet.Differences worsened as a deputy governor made critical remarks and the government cited the never used Section 7 of the RBI Act to force a discussion on the points of dispute.However, Patel\u2019s resignation was unexpected because the thorniest issues appeared to have been resolved last week ahead of the December 14 meeting of the RBI central board, where the row was playing out.The main agenda for that meeting was supposed to be the governance structure of the RBI. The government was said to be pushing for the central board to have more powers over the RBI despite the fact that many of the outside directors have other business interests, including some in financial services, potentially setting up conflicts of interest.
