This information came out as a follow-up to a reply received under right to information (RTI).\u000a\u000aTo understand the nature and quality of surveillance, Moneylife had filed an RTI query a few months back, requesting information on SEBI\u2019s surveillance statistics and had asked the market regulator about the number of cases its IMSS and Data Warehousing Business Intelligence System (DWBIS) had detected up to 28 February 2018.\u000a\u000aWe had asked for the dates, agenda and discussions of meetings in which the SEBI board was apprised of functioning of its Surveillance Department (ISD). We also asked for the format of the periodic reports submitted by the surveillance department to the key personnel in charge.\u000a\u000aUsing the link provided by SEBI, we searched for more details of the board meetings where matters of surveillance were discussed, and the companies detected by the sophisticated surveillance systems. Our observations were:\u000a\u000a1. Discussion on the matters of surveillance relating to the companies detected happened last on 23 September 2016, more than two years ago!\u000a\u000a2. The SEBI board met around four to six times each year, and matters related to surveillance were discussed at nearly every meeting prior to the meeting on 23 November 2016.\u000a\u000a3. The content of these discussions, and the actions taken, were published under the subject head \u2018Surveillance Action\u2019 and contained useful data such as name of companies whose shares saw abnormal trading activity and actions taken by SEBI against the promoters.\u000a\u000a4. Name of entities found through IMSS, against whom SEBI has taken action used to be publicly shared under item no. 3 \u2018significant surveillance measures\u2019 prior to its board meeting on 30 November 2015.\u000a\u000a5. After this meeting, SEBI started using "This portion has been excised for reasons of confidentiality" to conceal names of the entities on its website.\u000a\u000a6. In 2016, the board met five times and the subject of surveillance was discussed in four of those meeting. However, all the details, including action taken and names of companies were now hidden under the garb of confidentiality.\u000a\u000a7. In 2017 and 2018, the board met for a total eight times but the subject of \u2018Surveillance Action\u2019 was no more part of discussion in any of the meetings.\u000a\u000aEarlier in April 2013, Moneylife had filed an RTI requesting similar information from SEBI on its surveillance statistics and cases reported by its sophisticated systems. Their RTI response was \u201cIt is informed that the information sought by you is not available with the concerned department of SEBI.\u201d ( Read: SEBI says, don\u2019t have info on surveillance system and prosecution!\u000a\u000aThis was a shocking disclosure by the regulator who had touted that its surveillance systems will \u201cexploit the power of modern technology in terms of computation and speed of data analysis\u201d and \u201chost pattern recognition algorithms\u201d to crack insider trading.\u000a\u000aWe then filed our first appeal before the First Appellate Authority (FAA) at SEBI. In the appeal, we requested the FAA to direct the PIO to forward the RTI application to the concerned department that has the information. The FAA, however, rejected the first appeal. ( Read: Now, SEBI says it has no information on surveillance either! . Meanwhile, insider trading and market manipulation continues unabated. Even a high-profile deal of Reliance Industries taking over Hathaway and DEN Networks was openly exploited by insiders.
