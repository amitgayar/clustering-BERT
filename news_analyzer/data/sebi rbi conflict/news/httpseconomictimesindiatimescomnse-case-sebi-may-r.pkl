VMUMBAI: The Securities and Exchange Board of India Sebi ) may have to examine the constitution of its high-powered advisory committee ( HPAC ) on consent orders after two members were seen to have a potential conflict of interest in the National Stock Exchange ( NSE ) case on co-location and alleged preferential treatment.The two members are lawyer Dharmishta N Raval and Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP chairman PR Ramesh. \u201cI will request Sebi to permit me to recuse myself,\u201d Raval told ET. Ramesh said he wouldn\u2019t comment on the matter.An email sent to Sebi went unanswered. Raval, a former executive director of Sebi, is on the board of NSE. Deloitte had conducted a forensic audit of NSE\u2019s algorithm trading system as part of the investigation into the unfair access allegations.NSE said on July 20 that it had filed an application with Sebi to settle the matter through the consent mechanism. The regulator has been investigating allegations that NSE gave a few high-frequency traders and brokers preferential access to its trading platform.The HPAC consists of a retired high court judge and three external experts having securities market expertise. The current panel consists of retired Bombay High Court judge Vijay C Daga, former Reserve Bank deputy governor Anand Sinha, Raval and Ramesh.\u201cConsidering the sensitivity of the case, everything will have to be looked into by Sebi and how to address these issues,\u201d said a person close to the development. Lawyers said Sebi rules require a quorum of three to decide on any consent case.That poses a problem. \u201cIn the event of the committee being of less than three people, the committee would legally be unable to decide the case,\u201d said Sandeep Parekh, founder of Finsec Law Advisors. \u201cSebi will have to see whether it is willing to create an alternate bench like in the judiciary to make a quorum excluding the recused members by inviting a new member for a specific case.\u201dIntroduced in 2007, Sebi\u2019s consent mechanism is modelled on the lines of the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s settlement system, offering quick remedies to cases that can otherwise get entangled in long-drawn litigation. It is a negotiation platform between the regulator and the entity without admission or denial of guilt.The consent involves the party paying a settlement amount and, in some cases, agreeing to undertake certain restrictions voluntarily after suggestions from Sebi.The consent process involves several stages. Once the settlement terms are agreed upon by the regulator and the entity, it is then placed before the independent advisory committee, which after examining the terms either recommends them, rejects them or suggests modifications.Based on the panel\u2019s recommendations, Sebi\u2019s two whole-time members then pass the final order, which is binding on the applicant and can be only challenged by a third party investor impacted by the consent.\u201cIf the members have finished the term of three years or where public perception appears to be compromised by an interest held by a member, Sebi can technically reconstitute the committee,\u201d said Sumit Agrawal, partner, Suvan Law Advisors.
