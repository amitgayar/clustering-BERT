VLess than a week after the government had asked the Supreme Court for a correction in its order on the Rafale jet fighter deal, the Congress has continued to keep up the pressure on the government.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe want a JPC as we\u2019ll only get to know everything when Parliament members sit and look into the files. A JPC was formed in Bofors and 2G cases also. How can there be a typo? Had it been one word it would\u2019ve been understandable, entire paragraph can\u2019t be a typo,\u201d Congress Lok Sabha floor leader Mallikarjun Kharge told ANI on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aLast Saturday, the defence ministry had filed an application before the Supreme Court for the correction of a paragraph in its order on the Rafale jet fighter deal.\u000a\u000aThough the court\u2019s ruling effectively vindicated the government\u2019s stand that due process had been followed in reaching the Rs 59,000 crore deal, and had said that there was no reason to order a probe by the CBI.\u000a\u000aHowever, the Congress pointed out that the judgment had referred to the government\u2019s stand that the pricing details had been shared with the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, and that the government auditor had submitted a redacted report to parliament. It also indicated that parliament\u2019s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) had examined the report.\u000a\u000aThat error had been picked up by the petitioners and the opposition which had claimed that the government had misled the court with its original submission.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow does the Supreme Court judgment have this line that Rafale pricing has been examined by the PAC. Now, we have to ask the government, where is this CAG report?\u201d Congress president Rahul Gandhi had said at that time.\u000a\u000aThe original paragraph in the order (paragraph 25) said: \u201cThe pricing details have, however, been shared with the Comptroller and Auditor General (hereinafter referred to as CAG), and the report of the CAG has been examined by the Public Accounts Committee\u2026 Only a redacted portion ...was placed before the Parliament and is in public domain.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn its submission asking for a correction, the defence ministry had said that the court seems to have misunderstood it, which was, it added, \u201cin the form of bullet points\u201d. According to the ministry, the \u201csecond bullet point\u201d read: \u201cThe Government has already shared the pricing details with the CAG. The report of the CAG is examined by the PAC. Only a redacted version of the report is placed before the Parliament and in public domain\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe petition had argued that the use of the word \u201cis\u201d was \u201ca description of the procedure usually followed\u201d and asked the court to replace \u201chas been\u201d in paragraph 25, which seems to suggest that the act has already taken place, with \u201cis\u201d.\u000a\u000aIdeally, of course, the government\u2019s original submission should have used \u201cwill be\u201d instead of \u201cis\u201d to make things clear.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey have given wrong information to the court and on the basis of that information, the court has given its verdict. Now, I will request all the PAC panel members to fix a meeting to summon the attorney general and the Comptroller and Auditor General. We want to ask them when did they submit the Rafale report to the House and when did it come to the PAC, when did they come to give evidence, and when did we present the PAC report to Parliament?\u201d Kharge had said on Saturday.\u000a\u000aResponding to Congress\u2019 allegations of misleading the court and over which the party has been stalling the functioning of Parliament, Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said at that time that the error was a technicality.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe is going into technicality, I am going on substance. The court verdict is in 34 para(graph)s. It has dealt with all the issues (raised by Rahul). If he (Rahul) wants to find faults to do politics, I have nothing to say,\u201d Prasad had said.\u000a\u000aArun Jaitley had earlier too responded to the Congress\u2019 demands for a JPC saying that the Supreme Court judgement was clear and that the demand for a JPC probe was intended to prevent a discussion in Parliament.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe creators of falsehood will still persist with falsehood even at the cost of their own credibility. Only their captive constituencies will clap,\u201d he had written in a blog post on his site.
