VMaintaining that there was massive corruption in the Rafale deal, Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday fired a broadside at the Centre after it rejected the demand for a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe following the Supreme Court verdict rejecting pleas for a probe into the defence deal.\u000a\u000aReiterating the Congress\u2019 demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the fighter jet deal, Gandhi claimed that if it was conducted, names of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and businessman Anil Ambani will come to the fore.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe day this matter is investigated, two names will surface. Anil Ambani and Narendra Modi. I have said it earlier and I am saying it now, chowkidar chor hai (the guard is the thief),\u201d he said in a combative presser.\u000a\u000aThe Congress chief also wondered why the CAG report \u201ccited by the Supreme Court\u201d on it had not yet been shared with the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament. \u201cAs per the Govt\u2019s statement in the SC, pricing details have been shared with CAG and with the Public Accounts Committee. Mr. Kharge is chairman of PAC and he says, no such report regarding pricing was submitted,\u201d Gandhi said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf a report is submitted to PAC, then it must submit it to the Parliament and then put in the public domain, which has not happened,\u201d said Kharge, the opposition leader in Lok Sabha.\u000a\u000aGandhi further said it was not clear how Anil Ambani\u2019s company replaced HAL as the offset partner. \u201cOur questions are simple. Why was Rs 526Cr aircraft bought at Rs 1600Cr? Why was contract taken away from HAL and given to Anil Ambani? HAL is experienced and owns the land,\u201d said the Congress president.\u000a\u000aBoth government and Anil Ambani\u2019s Reliance Group have categorically rejected Gandhi\u2019s allegations of any wrongdoing.\u000a\u000aGandhi\u2019s reaction came hours after Union Finance Minister termed the opposition\u2019s allegations on the Rafale deal as \u201cfiction writing\u201d and that it compromised national security. Jaitley said every figure cited by Gandhi in his allegations has been false. He said the government would again press for a debate on the issue in Parliament.\u000a\u000aOn Congress\u2019 demand for a JPC probe into the deal, Jaitley said only judicial body can carry out such an investigation as there has been experience in the past of JPCs working on partisan lines. The SC verdict is conclusive and leaves no scope of any doubt on the deal, he said.\u000a\u000aThe Congress said the apex court has clearly stated that it is outside their jurisdiction to probe the Rafale deal. Party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said his party had said the top court cannot decide the Rafale issue and the alleged corruption in the defence contract can be brought out only by a Joint Parliamentary Committee.\u000a\u000aWelcoming the court\u2019s decision, Dassault Aviation said it is dedicated to establishing successfully \u2018Make in India\u2019 as promoted by PM Modi. \u201cDassault Aviation will ensure successful production in India through Dassault Reliance Joint Venture in Nagpur as well as through a full-fledged supply chain network,\u201d it said in a statement.\u000a\u000aIn a relief to the Modi government, the Supreme Court earlier in the day dismissed the pleas challenging the deal between India and France for procurement of 36 Rafale jets, saying there was no occasion to \u201creally doubt the decision making process\u201d warranting setting aside of the contract.\u000a\u000aThe apex court rejected the pleas which sought lodging of an FIR and a court-monitored probe alleging irregularities in the Rs 58,000 crore deal, in which both the countries have entered into an inter-governmental agreement.
