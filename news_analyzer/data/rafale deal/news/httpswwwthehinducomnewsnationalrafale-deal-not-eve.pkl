VThere is no question of an FIR, much less a CBI investigation, into the 36 Rafale aircraft purchase, the government told the Supreme Court on May 25.\u000a\u000aThere is no need for a probe as the Supreme Court itself, in a December 14, 2018 judgment, found it unnecessary to intervene in the sensitive defence purchase, it said.\u000a\u000a\u201cOnce the Supreme Court had come to the conclusion that on all the three aspects i.e., the decision-making process, pricing and Indian Offset Partner, there is no reason for intervention on the sensitive issue of purchase of 36 Rafale fighter aircraft by the government, there is no question of registration of FIR much less any investigation by the CBI,\u201d the Union of India said in its 39-page written submission filed in the Supreme Court.\u000a\u000aThe submission is in response to the review and perjury petitions filed by petitioners and former Union Ministers Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie and lawyer Prashant Bhushan alleging the government had concealed crucial facts and misled the apex court into giving a verdict favourable to the Rafale deal.\u000a\u000aThe petitioners had said their detailed complaint with the CBI for a probe was ignored. There had not been an attempt to even register an FIR or enquire into the complaint.\u000a\u000aBut the government countered there was no element of criminality as the Comptroller and Auditor-General (CAG) had rubbished claims that each jet was priced \u20b91,000 crore more than the earlier aborted deal by the UPA government with Dassault for 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA), the government said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn fact, the CAG has held that the 36 Rafale aircraft deal is 2.86% lower than the audit aligned price and in addition, there would be benefits on account of non-firm and fixed price. This itself negates the case of the petitioners of a prima facie criminal offence having been committed due to the payment of higher prices,\u201d the government, represented by Attorney-General K.K. Venugopal and R. Balasubramaniam, submitted.\u000a\u000aThe government said an enquiry need to be launched only if the complaint prima facie disclosed commission of cognizable offence. Even this, according to the government, was \u201clacking in the present case\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe government denied misleading the court into believing that the CAG report was already submitted in Parliament before the December 14 verdict was rendered. The petitioners had said the court was made to believe this by the government when the reality was there was no such report at that point of time. The report was filed in Parliament only on February 15, 2019.\u000a\u000aBut the government dismissed the error as \u201cmisunderstanding of language\u201d about which the petitioners had created a \u201cbig hue and cry\u201d. The Centre said the petitioners\u2019 claim that the government tried to mislead the court was \u201ccompletely false and preposterous\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe government claimed it was as transparent as it could be while dealing with a sensitive defence purchase. It said the basic price of the aircraft was informed to Parliament as approximately \u20b9670 crore at the prevailing exchange rate of November 2016 without associated equipment, weapons, India-specific enhancements, maintenance support and services. The price built up and a comparison with the price of the flyaway aircraft in the MMRCA bid was submitted to the Supreme Court in a sealed cover. All pricing details, files, documents and records were made available to the team of the CAG which worked out its own aligned cost.\u000a\u000aA review petition should not be a nomenclature for a \u201cfishing and roving enquiry\u201d on the basis of individual perceptions, the Centre said.\u000a\u000aThe government dismissed contentions by the petitioners about the benchmark price being exorbitantly high as a completely misleading allegation based on incomplete file noting and faulty assertions.\u000a\u000aIt said the waiver of sovereign/bank guarantee in government to government agreements/contracts was not unusual. \u201cSo far as the selection of Indian Offset Partners (IOPs) is concerned, there is no mention of any private Indian Business House(s) in IGA or Offset Contract,\u201d it said.\u000a\u000aThe deal was based on the final decisions taken by competent authorities, i.e., the Defence Minister, the Defence Acquisition Council and the Cabinet Committee on Security.\u000a\u000aThe Centre said allegations like \u201cDefence Minister was not consulted, Reliance Group paid \u20ac1.48 million to then French President Francois Hollande\u2019s partner\u2019s venture and RAL was not a legitimate offset partner\u201d were based on unsubstantiated media reports.\u000a\u000aThe agreement for the jets\u2019 procurement was \u201cbetween the two sovereign nations and the implementation of the project which is on schedule is being closely monitored by both the governments\u201d. Any delay in the implementation would affect the operational preparedness of the Air Force, the government said.
