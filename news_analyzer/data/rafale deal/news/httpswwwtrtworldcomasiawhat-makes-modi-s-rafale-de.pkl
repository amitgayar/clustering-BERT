VPrime Minister Narendra Modi is implicated in a snowballing scandal related to the procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets from France. Former French President Francois Hollande revealed in an interview released on September 21, 2018, that France did not have any other choice except for one company recommended by New Delhi for the deal. Owned by Anil Ambani, Reliance Aerostructure Limited \u2013 with no experience in aerospace manufacturing \u2013 became French aviation company Dassault Rafale's partner in India.\u000a\u000aOn Friday, Hollande, who was responsible for clearing the deal between the governments during his tenure, was quoted as stating that New Delhi had pressured Dassault to choose Reliance. Anil Ambani is the son of the late Dhirubhai Ambani, one of India\u2019s most powerful and richest business moguls.\u000a\u000aHollande stated, \u201cWe did not have a say in this. The Indian government proposed this group, and Dassault [the company that manufactured the jets] negotiated with Ambani. We did not have a choice, we took the interlocutor who was given to us.\u201d\u000a\u000aInvestigative journalists Karl Laske and Anton Rouget reported that Ambani\u2019s Reliance Defence provided funding for a film produced by President Hollande\u2019s partner, actress Julie Gayet. Ambani funded Gayet's film when the deal for 36 fighter jets with Reliance was completed.\u000a\u000aWhile Reliance appeared in the film\u2019s credits, it was not mentioned in financing details presented to France\u2019s public body responsible for cinema. The film did not mention India, or distribute in it. Former President Hollande is likely speaking now given the focus on his partner\u2019s film relative to the deal. In an attempt to deny this, he has declared the Reliance Defence was picked because France was given no choice by the Indian government. \u201cI could not even imagine that there was any connection to a film by Julie Gayet,\u201d he stated.\u000a\u000aThe focus of the scandal rests on Prime Minister Modi\u2019s sudden decision to secretly end a previous deal that sought 18 fighter jets from France and largely focused on training the local workforce through the transfer of technology. Instead of relying on foreign imports, the previous government led by the Congress party aimed at manufacturing 108 aircrafts in India. But Modi single-handedly changed the terms of the deal and agreed to procure 36 fighter jets.\u000a\u000aRahul Gandhi, Indian Congress president, has lashed out, calling it the "biggest ever" corruption scandal, accusing Prime Minister Modi of changing the deal to benefit \u201chis friend\u201d Anil Ambani. He declared, \u201cThe fun part is that the contract was given to Ambaniji, who has never made an aeroplane in his life nor has he ever taken a contract for defence.\u201d\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s defense procurement rules mandate that foreign firms must invest at least 30 percent of contracts in India to build local technological capacity.\u000a\u000aFormer ministers Arun Shourie and Yashwant Sinha have also criticised the deal, noting \u201cNeither Reliance Defence nor any of its allied companies have any experience of manufacturing aerospace and defence equipment.\u201d The original fighter jet deal was supposed to include Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), which activist lawyer Prashant Bushan noted \u201chas over 60 years of experience in aircraft manufacturing ....\u201d\u000a\u000aBushan contrasts this to Reliance Defence, which he said is \u201ca private party which has had absolutely no experience in manufacturing aerospace and defence equipment has been handed an enormous financial benefit.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo add to the controversy, critics point to the fact that Anil Ambani\u2019s Reliance Group incorporated a defence company just 12 days before Modi announced the new Rafale deal. Ambani also accompanied Modi on his visit to France, resulting in accusations of a breach of confidence and cronyism. Reliance Defence\u2019s responses to the allegations have neglected to mention ties between Modi and Ambani. Ambani had previously publicly called Modi "king of kings."\u000a\u000a"The PM personally negotiated and changed the Rafale deal behind closed doors. Thanks to François Hollande, we now know he personally delivered a deal worth billions of dollars to ... Anil Ambani," said Rahul Gandhi, president of opposition Congress party. \u201cThe prime minister has betrayed India,\u201d he concluded.\u000a\u000aThe breach of confidence allegations take on new strength in light of the highly secretive conditions of the changed deal, with  former defence minister Manohar Parrikar being informed about the deal only shortly before Modi left Paris to make the announcement. Even India\u2019s foreign secretary was not informed about the deal. To add more confusion, Dassault CEO Eric Trappier recently made a public statement saying that the original 126-aircraft deal was \u201c95 percent complete.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnand Sharma, the opposition leader from the Congress party demanded that the prime minister respond to the charges made against him. At a news conference he said, \u201cMy direct charge is that the prime minister violated the oath of confidentiality. Only he could have told Anil Ambani that HAL [Hindustan Aerospace Limited] will be out and he will strike a deal to buy 36 jets, and \u2018you\u2019 [Ambani] go and talk to Dassault aviation [Rafale Jet Manufacturers].\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile the most cited reason for the deal change is the \u201ccollapse of negotiations,\u201d no response has been given on the illegality of Modi\u2019s individual decision to change the deal without gaining approval of relevant cabinet committees, or undermining fellow ministers of Defence and Finance.\u000a\u000aThe Indian Congress President Rahul Gandhi had previously accused the government of significant inconsistencies after the deal was announced, given that the finalised price from the initial deal went from $72.3 million (526 crore) to $2.3 billion (Rs 1670 crore), nearly triple the price.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine had launched investigations into another deal for the purchase of spares for military transport aircrafts, with personal kickbacks worth $2.6 million (RS 17.55 crore) to Ministry of Defence Officials in the Modi government. The government did not to respond or provide details on the deal.\u000a\u000aIndian Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has hit back, stating that she did not even know who Dassault\u2019s partner was, calling it \u201ca commercial decision,\u201d while procedure calls for partnership clearance in 2019. This is suspect however, given that Dassault and Reliance have publicly declared in joint-press releases that they were working together, with the foundation stone for their joint-manufacturing facility laid as early as October 2017 with Indian ministers in attendance.\u000a\u000aModi and his government did not respond to request for comment, and have yet to officially respond to the growing scandal.
