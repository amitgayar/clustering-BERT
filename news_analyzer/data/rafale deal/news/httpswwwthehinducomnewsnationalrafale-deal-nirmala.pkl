VAs new evidence of interference by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) in the Rafale negotiations appeared in an exclusive story in The Hindu on Friday, the government, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, sought to defend itself by citing then Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar\u2019s file notings, which appeared to downplay the concerns of the then Defence Secretary G. Mohan Kumar.\u000a\u000aThe Hindu reported that officials of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had raised a red flag over the PMO\u2019s direct negotiations with the French government that \u2014 they noted in the file \u2014 undermined the official negotiating team\u2019s position.\u000a\u000aBelow Mr. Kumar\u2019s noting, Mr. Parrikar wrote: \u201cIt appears that the PMO and French President\u2019s office are monitoring the progress of issues which was an outcome of the summit meeting and Para 5 appears to be an overreaction. Def Sec may resolve issue/matter in consultation with the Pr. Sec to PM.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Parrikar\u2019s noting reiterates all the facts noted by officials in the file, and reported by The Hindu, though he characterised part of the note as an \u201coverreaction,\u201d before asking the Defence Secretary to deal directly with the PMO, effectively delegating responsibility for resolving the issue to the Ministry\u2019s top official.\u000a\u000aIn Parliament, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman termed the questions regarding the PMO\u2019s direct interference in the negotiations as \u201cflogging a dead horse\u201d and accused the Opposition of playing into the hands of multinational companies and vested interests. \u201cThey are flogging a dead horse. Periodical enquiries by the PMO cannot be construed as interference,\u201d she told the Lok Sabha.\u000a\u000aShe also rebuffed the Opposition charge and asserted that if the PMO\u2019s monitoring of a deal was construed as interference, one needed to recall that as the then Chairperson of the National Advisory Council, Sonia Gandhi used to run the PMO regularly during the UPA regime. The Defence Minister contended that Mr. Parrikar had replied to the letter by asking the official to remain \u201ccalm\u201d as everything was \u201callright.\u201d \u201cThis selective kind of noting and building an issue falsely on it is completely called out today,\u201d Ms. Sitharaman told reporters.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe response of the then Defence Minister was very clear\u2026 Under the direction of the same Defence Secretary, who was also the member of the negotiating committee, with his signature the file went to the Cabinet Committee on Security for approval,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aDefence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said then Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar had addressed the concerns raised by officials over the Rafale negotiations.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe response of the then Defence Minister was very clear\u2026 Under the direction of the same Defence Secretary, who was also the member of the negotiating committee, with his signature the file went to the Cabinet Committee on Security for approval,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aThe Hindu\u2019s report published an official communication in which MoD officials raise questions on how the PMO was holding \u201cparallel negotiations\u201d alongside the Indian Negotiating Team (INT). Mr. Parrikar\u2019s noting in the letter was initially made public by the news agency ANI.\u000a\u000aThough Ms. Sitharaman quoted it to defend the government\u2019s stand, it raises more questions both on the manner in which the Defence Secretary was asked to go easy, and whether the Defence Minister was entirely in the know about all aspects of the negotiations.\u000a\u000aCommenting on Mr. Parrikar\u2019s role in the negotiations, former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah tweeted, \u201cThe then Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar was clueless about the progress of negotiations. All he could say was \u201cIT APPEARS that PMO & French President\u2019s office are monitoring the progress\u201d. He had no direct knowledge of progress & passed the buck back to the PMO.\u201d\u000a\u000aFollowing the revelations, the then Defence Secretary G. Mohan Kumar told ANI that the MoD letter had nothing to do with price. \u201cIt was about sovereign guarantees and general terms and conditions.\u201d The government had repeatedly stated that the deal was between two sovereign governments and it was only recently revealed that the French government had given a \u2018Letter of Comfort\u2019 in lieu of sovereign guarantees.\u000a\u000aIn a recent written reply in the Rajya Sabha, Ms. Sitharaman asserted that the \u2018Letter of Comfort\u2019 signed by the French Prime Minister and the IGA provide \u201cadequate safeguards.\u201d Also any dispute in the execution of the IGA would be settled through the Bilateral High Level Group established by the two governments, she added. \u201cAny dispute not settled by this group shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law) arbitration rules,\u201d Ms. Sitharaman wrote in the reply, indicating that despite the deal being negotiated through an IGA a dispute could be referred to a third party for resolution.\u000a\u000aFurther, Mr. Parrikar\u2019s comment that the PMO might be \u201cmonitoring the progress of issues\u201d strengthens arguments that the interference may have adversely affected the INT\u2019s leverage.
