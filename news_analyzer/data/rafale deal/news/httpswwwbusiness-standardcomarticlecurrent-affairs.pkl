VThe Congress on Friday upped the ante on its demand for a (JPC) probe in the Rafale fighter jet deal. This was after a news report published in revealed the defence ministry had objected to the Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) conducting parallel negotiations with the French side to seal the deal in 2015.\u000a\u000aCongress president held a press conference on Friday, where he said the report was proof the PMO intervened in the deal. \u201cIt is absolutely clear the prime minister (PM) has stolen Rs 30,000 crore of your money, bypassed a process, and given it to his friend Anil Ambani," Gandhi said. He added it was clear the PM was \u201cdirectly involved in the Rafale scam\u201d, and it is proven now the watchman (chowkidar) is the thief (chor).\u000a\u000aDefending the government in the Lok Sabha, Defence Minister dismissed the media report. She accused the Opposition of playing into the hands of multinational companies, and vested interests. This accusation came after Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge demanded a JPC probe, citing the news report.\u000a\u000a"They are flogging a dead horse. Periodical enquiries by the PMO cannot be construed as interference," she clarified. The Opposition raised the issue in both the Houses, with the Rajya Sabha adjourned for the day. The Lok Sabha, too, was briefly adjourned when the Congress, and others, staged a walkout as the House took up the discussion on the interim Budget.\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAccording to the news report, the then Defence Secretary, G Mohan Kumar had brought the fact of this parallel negotiation to the attention of the then defence minister, Manohar Parrikar. In the note dated November 24, 2015, Kumar said such parallel discussions by the PMO had \u201cweakened the negotiating position of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the Indian negotiating team\u201d.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn the note, the ministry had protested, saying the PMO's position was \u201ccontradictory to the one by the MoD and the negotiating team.\u201d Kumar had made this official notation with himself: \u201cRM (Raksha Mantri) may pl. see. It is desirable that such discussions be avoided by the PMO, as it undermines our negotiating position seriously.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to the note The Hindu reproduced, the details of the parallel negotiations came to the ministry\u2019s notice from a letter dated October 23, 2015 from Stephen Reb, head, French negotiating team.\u000a\u000aThe note stated, \u201cWe may advise the PMO that any officer, who is not part of the Indian negotiating team, may refrain from having parallel parleys with the officers of the French government\u201d. It suggested, \u201cIn case the PMO is not confident about the negotiations by the MoD, a revised modality of negotiations to be led by the PMO at appropriate level may be adopted.\u201d\u000a\u000aAttacking the Centre, Gandhi remarked, \u201cWhatever inquiry you want to do, you do it. You implement the law. Robert Vadra, P Chidambaram \u2014 you implement the law on everyone. (Their is) no problem. But, you also (have to) give answers on the Rafale matter.\u201d BJP leaders, including Prakash Javadekar, termed Gandhi's allegations as another "lie from his lie-manufacturing factory". Sitharaman said Parrikar had replied to the letter asking the official to remain "calm", as everything was "alright". In her suo motu statement in the House, Sitharaman alleged the then chairperson of the Advisory Council Sonia Gandhi ran the PMO regularly during the UPA regime. \u201cWas that not interference?\u201d she asked.\u000a\u000aLater, she also questioned the newspaper\u2019s \u201cethics of journalism\u201d for publishing only part of the noting, but cropping out the reply by the then defence minister.\u000a\u000aN Ram, Chairman of Group, and the author of the report, said he did not need a certificate from Sitharaman. \u201cThe story is complete in itself because we have not dealt with Manohar Parrikar's role in this, and that needs investigation," Ram said. He said the release of the \u2018complete\u2019 note has authenticated the story. Parrikar\u2019s noting was made a month after that of the defence secretary.\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aALSO READ: PM Modi 'frontman for corporate friends': Congress on Rafale deal\u000a\u000aFurthermore, Trinamool Congress\u2019 Saugata Roy alleged that "notorious" Security Advisor Ajit Doval was conducting parallel negotiations in Paris, undermining the bargaining power of the government. In his comments outside the House, former defence minister A K Antony said it was \u201cshocking\u201d the PMO was conducting such negotiations, and alleged it had "special interests to protect". \u201cIn defence negotiations, only the defence ministry is involved,\u201d Antony said.\u000a\u000a\u201cModi has consistently undermined the Air Force and MoD in the for corruption, to benefit his cronies. His actions have hurt the public exchequer, and damaged security. These facts have been hidden from the Supreme Court, where a review petition is pending," CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury tweeted.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the light of today\u2019s expose on Rafale, 'independent' CBI should raid the PMO, seize all the files related to Rafale, and make arrests just like they raided my office and residence, that of the Kolkata police commissioner,\u201d Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said.
