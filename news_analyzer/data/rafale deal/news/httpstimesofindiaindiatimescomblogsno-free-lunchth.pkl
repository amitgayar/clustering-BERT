VThe Congress Party under the leadership of Rahul is on meltdown mode. People from all walks of life are fed up with his eternal press conferences about the Rafale deal and the effort he is putting into bringing the BJP down without offering one single point on what he would do as the Prime Minister of India.\u000a\u000aToday, I watched a number of YouTube channels that are not on the mainstream media and they were from Bengal to Uttar Pradesh including many states in between. I realized one thing from the various short interviews of Indians from the Kumbh Mela to various states in India, that Rahul\u2019s constant attack on the Prime Minister is just not working.\u000a\u000aIndians are just not buying it. They hate his press conferences on a single issue; they dislike the fact that he lies; and most of all they feel that the Congress is trying devious ways to attack PM Modi, including a pretty desperate attack on Electronic Voting Machines,  (EVMs) in London, where a Congress Minister, Kapil Sibal was present, with a pretty shady guy from New York, who allowed himself to be named but not seen! The whole episode was so steamy that even the Press Association of UK, said they were not involved in it.\u000a\u000aThese seem like desperate tactics by desperate people.\u000a\u000aI predict the Congress Party will come in with even a lower representation in the General Elections. Notwithstanding the American who has been brought in to coach Rahul, the Congress really has lost the connect with the people of India.\u000a\u000aI just wonder why they would hire an American when the Indian democracy and voter is so different? Just shows how out of touch they are with the voters.\u000a\u000aI was in Bhopal just a few weeks ago and just about everyone I spoke to from the shopkeepers to taxi drivers, even in places out of Bhopal, told me that the BJP had turned Madhya Pradesh around. There was no road before connecting the airport to the city; driving at night from Bhopal to Indore before was something you did at your own risk. Today the state is safe, infrastructure such as highways, electricity and water are taken for granted. When I asked them why BJP had lost, they said it was by a very small margin and that too because the Congress had offered the farmers a big loan waiver. This they predicted would never happen to the tune of what was promised. Just a month later it seems to have come true.\u000a\u000aBhopal is one of the cleanest and prettiest cities I have visited and the Vikas is there for all to see. The roads to the Bhimbetka caves and Sanchi were great as well as the government tourist lodges where one got freshly cooked good food and clean toilets.\u000a\u000aComing back to the 2019 elections and my surfing news and YouTube about real-time data on what the ordinary Indians will vote for, one striking reply by an old voter when asked why he would not vote for Rahul Gandhi was: \u201cIf Rahul is the head of the Congress Party, and is so sure of his party\u2019s appeal, why does he have to form an alliance with others why can\u2019t he fight and win on his own?\u201d\u000a\u000aI realized once again how very aware an Indian voter is. Having lived in the US for 15 years, I am proud to say that our citizens not only cherish their right to vote but do it with great acumen.\u000a\u000aThe Indian voter is not fooled by regional parties coming together. The voters interviewed, young and old, men and women had the same view, \u201cModi has worked and delivered, the other parties only want to stay in power because they are in themselves dynasties, promoting their sons, daughters, or nieces and nephews. They kept promising us things would be better for us but delivered nothing. This time their grand plan is to get rid of Modi, nothing more.\u201d
