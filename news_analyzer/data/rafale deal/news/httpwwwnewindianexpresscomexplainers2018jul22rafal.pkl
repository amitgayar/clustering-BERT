VCongress President Rahul Gandhi in his recent Lok Sabha speech during the debate on the No-Confidence Motion against the Modi government, attacked Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for the umpteenth time over the Rafale fighter jet deal with France.\u000a\u000aIn his latest jibe, Rahul accused Sitharaman of \u201clying\u201d to the nation over the Rafale deal\u2019s \u2018secrecy\u2019, while the Defence Minister has outrightly denied the claim.\u000a\u000aSince the Rafale deal was signed in 2016, Congress and BJP have been at loggerheads. Here\u2019s a comprehensive look at the twists and turns in what the two parties have said on the issue over the last three years.\u000a\u000aThe Congress slammed the Modi government for compromising national security and alleged that a huge scam was brewing in the procurement of Rafale fighter aircraft for the Indian Air Force. The Congress said that the Modi government signed the Rafale deal on September 23, 2016, for the purchase of 36 Rafale fighter aircraft from Dassault for approximately Rs 58,000 crore and on October 3, Reliance Defence Limited, owned by Anil Ambani, tied up with the French company for a Joint venture for defence production in India. The Congress cited a Reliance document to point out that off-sets in the deal, which are half the cost of 36 aircraft, work out to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore. \u201cThat means the deal is worth Rs 60,000 crore,\u201d said Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, adding the government did not part with any information related to the deal despite several attempts by his party. Non-transparency in the deal also denied the transfer of technology to the public sector Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, the Congress further said.\u000a\u000a"Dear RM, what's shameful is your boss silencing you.\u000a\u000aPlease tell us:\u000a\u000a2. Did PM take CCS permission before announcing purchase in Paris?\u000a\u000a3. Why PM bypassed experienced HAL and gave the deal to AA rated businessman with no defence experience?" Rahul tweeted.\u000a\u000aRahul Gandhi, at a poll rally in Gujarat said, "I would ask Modiji three questions (on the Rafale deal). First, is there a difference in the cost of planes in the first and the second contract (signed with a French firm) and did India pay more or less money as per the second contract? And, has the industrialist (whose company has formed a joint venture with the French firm), who was given the contract, ever manufactured planes?" Further, he said, \u201cAnd a more important question, did you follow the due government procedure? Why the (then) defence minister (Manohar Parrikar) was seen catching fish in Goa? And, was an approval from the Cabinet Committee on Security taken (for the mega deal)? Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley hit back at Rahul, saying unlike during Congress regimes when middlemen ruled the roost, there was no \u201cQuattrocchi" in the contract for the Rafale fighter jet. Jaitley was referring to Ottavio Quattrocchi, the Italian businessman believed to be involved in the Bofors scam which came to light when Rajiv Gandhi was the Prime Minister.\u000a\u000aRM says the price negotiated for each RAFALE jet by the PM and his \u201creliable\u201d buddy is a state secret.\u000a\u000aAction Points: 1.Informing Parliament about the price is a national security threat, 2.Brand all who ask, Anti National.\u201d\u000a\u000aCongress president Rahul Gandhi accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of protecting those behind alleged corruption in the Rafale deal. He noted that it is for the first time that the Defence Minister is saying "we will not tell the country". "This is the biggest deal for the backbone of the Air Force, but Defence Minister says we will not tell the country as it is a secret, under a deal struck in Paris". Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma also alleged there was a big scam in the Rafale deal as the price at which the planes were negotiated were four times higher and benefitted private firms. The Centre then came out with a detailed statement rebutting Congress\u2019 allegations. The Modi administration said the current deal \u201cis better in terms of capability, price, equipment, delivery, maintenance, training, etc than that notionally negotiated by the then government (UPA II) in a process it could not conclude in ten years\u201d.\u000a\u000a\u201cQ. Why did the Raksha Mantri change her stance from: I will reveal the price of the RAFALE planes in Nov 2017 to the price is a state secret in Feb 2018\u000a\u000aAt a BJP Parliamentary Party meeting, he told MPs that sharing all details of the deal such as expenditure incurred on its weaponry and the technological know-how will only alert India's enemies and harm the country's interests. On the other hand, defence ministry sources claimed that the original deal to procure 126 Rafale fighter jets could not go through during the UPA rule despite reaching the final stage as the then Defence Minister A K Antony felt there was something wrong in the process and asked for a review. At a Karnataka election rally, Rahul Gandhi however, intensifying his attack on the Centre over the Rafale fighter jet deal, alleged it was the biggest issue of corruption in the country and asked the prime minister to reply why he took the contract from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and gave it to a "friend".\u000a\u000a\u201cModi ji, last month you ignored my suggestions for your Mann Ki Baat monologue. Why ask for ideas when in your heart you know what every Indian wants to hear you speak about?\u000a\u000aI look forward to your sermon.\u201d\u000a\u000a"Our Defence Minister said she would, but now she won\u2019t.\u000a\u000aThe PM squirms when asked about the price of RAFALE and refuses to look me in the eye.\u000a\u000a"Mr 56 does love (heart emoji) someone after all.\u000a\u000a1. Must wear a suit\u000a\u000a 2. Must have Rs 45,000 Crore debt\u000a\u000a 3. Must have a TEN day old company. \u000a\u000a 4. Must never have made an aircraft in his life.\u000a\u000aRewards of up to USD 4 billion in 'offset' contracts if you fulfil said criteria."\u000a\u000aThe Congress said that PM Modi should tell the nation why the Rs 30,000-cr offset contract was given to a company without any licence for manufacture of aircraft and in absence of a land and building. "Reliance Defence Ltd did not have the licence to manufacture fighter aircraft. Intriguingly, Reliance Aerostructure Ltd. was given the licence to manufacture fighter aircraft by the Defence Ministry but it did not own any land or building on the date of the licence, which is 22nd February, 2016," said Congress leader Randeep Surjewala.\u000a\u000a"Over the next 50 years, Indian Tax Payers will pay Mr 56's friend's JV, Rs 100,000 Crore to maintain 36 #RafaleScam jets, India is buying.\u000a\u000aRaksha Mantri will address a Press CON to deny this, as usual.\u000a\u000aBut the truth is in the presentation I\u2019m attaching."
