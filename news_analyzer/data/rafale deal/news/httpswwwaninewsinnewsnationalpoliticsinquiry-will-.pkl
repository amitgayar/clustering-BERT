VBarabanki (Uttar Pradesh) [India], Apr 22 (ANI): Attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Rafale deal, Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Monday said that an inquiry will be ordered on it if Congress returns to power after the Lok Sabha elections.\u000a\u000aWhile addressing a rally here, Rahul said, \u201cWhen BJP leaders and the Prime Minister come here and give false speeches, then for once ask him why he gave Rs 30,000 crore to Anil Ambani. Also, ask him what did Anil Ambani do for him in return? Kyunki muft mei thodi hota hai\u2026 What did you get in return?\u201d\u000a\u000aHe added, \u201cJaise hi hamari sarkar ayegi na\u2026 jo chal raha hai Rafale ka\u2026 Inquiry hogi. Inquiry hogi Modi ji. Inquiry hogi aur sachai bahar ayegi. What French President said will come out. The whole country will get to know what is written in the files of the Defence Ministry. Only two people\u2019s names will come out \u2013 Anil Ambani and Narendra Modi.\u201d\u000a\u000aRahul also claimed that the BJP has done \u201cstep motherly treatment towards Amethi.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy plan is to make Amethi the education centre of the country,\u201d he said. Rahul has been representing Amethi Lok Sabha constituency in Parliament since 2004. This is the fourth time he will be contesting from the seat.\u000a\u000aFurther attacking the Prime Minister, Rahul said: \u201cPrime Minister Narendra Modi has waived off loans worth Rs 5,55,000 crore of 15 people. This means money was stolen from people\u2019s pockets and given to Mehul Choksi, Neerav Modi, Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi and Anil Ambani\u2026 But when farmers ask to waive off their loans, then the Prime Minister says I won\u2019t do it\u201d.\u000a\u000aHe added, \u201c\u2018Chowkidar\u2019 din bhar jhoot bolta hai. Usne paanch saal Hindustan ka time zaya kiya (\u2018Chowkidar\u2019 keeps lying the whole day. He has only wasted the country's time for the past five years).\u000a\u000a\u201cPehle 100 din dete they na, iss baar 150 din denge. Jo inhone garibo se cheena, kisano se, mazduro se, yuvao se cheena, uska dugna mein Anil Ambani jaise choro se cheenkar yaha dalunga,\u201d he said. (ANI)
