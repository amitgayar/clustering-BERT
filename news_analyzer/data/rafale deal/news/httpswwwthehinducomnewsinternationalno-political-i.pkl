The final deal was sealed on September 23, 2016.\u000a\u000aThe Congress has been alleging massive irregularities in the deal, saying the government was procuring each aircraft at a cost of over \u20b91,670 crore as against \u20b9526 crore finalised by the UPA government when it was negotiating the deal.\u000a\u000aThe Congress has also been targeting the government over selection of Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Defence as an offset partner for Dassault Aviation, the manufacturer of Rafale. The government has rejected the allegations.\u000a\u000aThe French newspaper said the company was investigated by French tax authorities and found liable to pay 60 million euros in taxes for the period 2007 to 2010.\u000a\u000aHowever, Reliance offered to pay 7.6 million euros only as a settlement but French tax authorities refused to accept the amount.
