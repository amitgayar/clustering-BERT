VTHIS Morning fans slammed a conspiracy theorist who claimed that the moon landing was a hoax.\u000a\u000aViewers called the guest an "idiot" and said he should be sent into space after he also suggested it is translucent.\u000a\u000aAsked by host Eamonn Holmes about the evidence he is using to back up his claims, the man said: "None of us have ever landed on the moon.\u000a\u000a"So the only way we can discern whether this happened or not is by studying the actual data that was taken during those Apollo missions. Right?"\u000a\u000aShaking her head, the scientist interjected: "That's not true, that's not true."\u000a\u000aThe guest shot back: "Let me finish!"\u000a\u000aThose watching at home took to Twitter in disbelief at the guest's bizarre claims as the conversation got more and more heated.\u000a\u000aOne wrote: "Who is this idiot on @thismorning talking about the moon landings being faked and the moon is translucent? #thismorning"\u000a\u000aAnother commented: "Who is this absolute idiot on #ThisMorning saying the moon landing didn\u2019t happen? Does the moon not exist at all...??! #hahaha"\u000a\u000aA third shared: "When someone goes on national TV to say the moon is translucent. #ThisMorning"\u000a\u000aOthers joked that the man should be sent into space to find out himself.\u000a\u000aOne wrote: "Please send this man to the moon. #ThisMorning"\u000a\u000aAnother posted: "#ThisMorning someone put that moon hoax guy in a big f***off rocket & send him to the moon"\u000a\u000aHowever, other viewers agreed with the guest that the landing never happened.\u000a\u000aOne added: "@thismorning I don't believe the moon landings happened... but this guy isn't doing much to help prove it. He's away with the fairies."\u000a\u000aAnother wrote: "The moon landing was fake, end of #thismorning"\u000a\u000aA third commented: "Of course they never landed on the moon!! #ThisMorning"\u000a\u000aIt comes as a video where Buzz Aldrin appeared to admit to a young child that he never went to the moon went viral.\u000a\u000aIn fact it turns out that parts of the Apollo 11 astronaut's answers were actually left out from the clip to make it appear he was saying something he didn't.\u000a\u000aIn the viral video, it seems like Aldrin is saying "we didn't go there".\u000a\u000aHowever, the clip cut out various words from Aldrin's long and garbled answer.\u000a\u000aThe astronaut's full answer, however, was actually seeking to explain why nobody has gone back to the moon since December 1972.\u000a\u000aIt was not intending to answer why nobody had been to the moon in the first place.\u000a\u000aGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220.\u000a\u000aWe pay for videos too.
