Consuming himself in the science and theories surrounding this monumental event, absorbing new facts and suspicious details, he would love nothing more than to be proven wrong.\u201d\u000a\u000aApollo 11 landed the first two humans on the moon and Commander Neil Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface on July 21, 1969.\u000a\u000aThere are conspiracy theorists who believe the landing was faked.\u000a\u000aWhat: No Moon Landing \u2013 Paintings & Sculpture by Jack Winn\u000a\u000aWhen: Until July 30; opening reception Saturday, 7 p.m., and artist talk July 27, 2 p.m.
