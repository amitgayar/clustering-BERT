VThe spread of HIV/AIDS in Russia is often called an epidemic, but the fight against the disease has a peculiar enemy: denialists who say it's all a hoax. They aren't just bloggers and celebrities, but influential medics too.\u000a\u000aThe human immunodeficiency virus was first discovered in 1983 in the US and France. As newspaper headlines announced the grim discovery, the denialists soon followed. Almost four decades have passed since, but they\u2019re still going strong in Russia and abroad.\u000a\u000a\u201cHIV/AIDS was a major thing that drew global attention\u2026 and people tried to find a conspiracy behind all that \u2013 much the same way that some people believe that the US Moon landing was a hoax, and the fake footage was produced in Hollywood,\u201d Anton Krasovsky, an HIV-positive journalist, said in \u2018Epidemic\u2019, a new documentary he shot for RTD.\u000a\u000aThere are around one million people living with HIV in Russia, with 86 thousand learning of their illness in 2018. Though 2018\u2019s figures represented a slight decrease compared to previous years, scientists and experts still refer to the situation as an \u201cepidemic.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn Episode 1, Krasovsky and his film crew made a journey to Irkutsk Region, where more than 1.6 percent of the population are infected. Despite the region\u2019s state of \u2018generalized epidemic\u2019, Irkutsk is home to one of the country\u2019s most vocal HIV deniers, former pathologist Vladimir Ageev.\u000a\u000aAgeev, who headed the pathology department at the local medical university, has written a number of books and made several TV appearances, insisting that HIV is \u201call lies\u201d invented by pharmaceutical corporations in order to gain profit.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m telling you, you aren\u2019t infected, you aren\u2019t sick,\u201d Ageev assured Krasovsky when the journalist opened up about his condition. Dismissing the mountains of scientific research confirming the existence of HIV/AIDS, Ageev called the research \u201cmanipulated,\u201d doctors \u201cbasically Nazis,\u201d and claimed that the Nobel Prize given to the European scientists who discovered the virus was awarded by \u201ccrooks.\u201d\u000a\u000aMeeting with Krasovsky in a darkened pool hall, Ageev was quick to anger when pressed on his denialism, and insisted that the journalist\u2019s sickness had another cause. \u201cYou are just hiding something,\u201d he thundered when Krasovsky told him he had an otherwise clean bill of health when his HIV was diagnosed.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am working as a therapist. People call me, come to talk to me from all over\u2026 and they\u2019re all alive,\u201d the former pathologist continued, adding that lethal cases of HIV/AIDS are not caused by the disease, but by conventional treatments for it.\u000a\u000aThe actions of Ageev and other deniers with medical diplomas are \u201ca real problem,\u201d Yulia Plotnikova, chief doctor of the Irkutsk AIDS center, said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s an obstruction that can derail all our efforts in working with patients. We\u2019ve seen so many tragedies, like a child\u2019s death, or a woman\u2019s death,\u201d she said, adding that it is sometimes almost impossible to persuade people to start treatment. Compounding her frustration, Plotnikova has seen her own, educated colleagues embrace denialism.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s so much worse when HIV/AIDS denialism is popular among medical professionals,\u201d she said. \u201cIf medical university professors say that HIV doesn\u2019t exist, their voices will be heard.\u201d\u000a\u000aKrasovsky, who is the head of the AIDS Center Foundation, also chatted with former HIV denialist, Maria Petrova, who has now completely abandoned her old beliefs. Standing at the cemetery where her husband is buried, Petrova is reminded every day of the consequences of dismissing the disease.\u000a\u000aPetrova\u2019s late husband, a drug addict, refused treatment. When Petrova caught the disease from her husband, she initially opted not to seek medical help, taking his word that HIV was \u201ca massive fraud of the 21st Century.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe just thought it was a hoax and he didn\u2019t have any disease,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just ruined me. He destroyed my life. I have no family. I have nothing; I\u2019m afraid to build anything.\u201d\u000a\u000aThink your friends would be interested? Share this story!
