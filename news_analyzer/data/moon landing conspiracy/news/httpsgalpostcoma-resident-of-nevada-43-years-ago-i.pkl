VBought for nearly $217 old films, 43 years of steel the treasure from the trunk of an old car. Now they are estimated at $2 million.\u000a\u000aIn 1976, the American Gary George was 22 years old. Then he was a student and studied at University to be an engineer and held a short practice at the Johnson Space center at NASA, says \u201cPresent.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe American space Agency in those years experienced a shortage of funds and tried to save. Because of this, it is regularly conducted sale of unnecessary or decommissioned equipment. In one of these auctions and attended Gary George. In just 217 dollars and 77 cents, he bought more than a thousand spools of film, which, presumably, were working materials NASA or its contractors.\u000a\u000aThe record, George did not need: he expected to sell the film to TV channels, so that they could use it again, writing over your content. While, the plan worked, and George was able to sell the stations as much as eight reels $50 each. But then the bobbin, changed the videocassette, and it turned out that outdated equipment unnecessary. The remaining film for many years was lying around in the car the engineer, until then, until he finally decided to get rid of it and transfer the junk to the Church.\u000a\u000aWhat surprise George when he found that the three reels is marked \u201cApollo 11 EVA\u201d: it is an acronym at NASA designated the lunar program. On the tapes, which were so marked, was the original shot of the landing of American astronauts on the moon July 20, 1969. And recording, as suggested by George, was taken by the camera of astronaut Neil Armstrong, the one that the astronaut was mounted on a tripod on the lunar surface.\u000a\u000aRecord the moon landing in 1969, NASA for many years was considered lost: officially, the Agency admitted this in 2006, stating that the original \u201cmoon shots\u201d were missing due to oversight. The inability to produce the original footage of the lunar landing at the time, gave rise to many conspiracy theories: that the American astronauts from the spaceship \u201cApollo-11\u201d actually never was in space, and the whole \u201clanding\u201d was staged and filmed in the halls of Hollywood.\u000a\u000aGeorge, according to him, all these years never knew what treasure lie in the trunk of an old car filming equipment he didn\u2019t have to watch film, he just could not. \u201cI had no idea that there is something so valuable\u201d, \u2013 he said to Reuters. To view tapes he could only in 2008, when they were first digitized.\u000a\u000aNow the engineer expects to sell three \u201cmoon\u201d film on Sotheby\u2019s auction. Including footage of Neil Armstrong utters the famous phrase \u201cone Small step for man but a big step for mankind\u201d and the conversation of astronaut buzz Aldrin with the then US President Richard Nixon.\u000a\u000aAccording to preliminary estimates, July 20, a man can receive for their lot at least $2 million, that is 10 thousand times more than I paid for it 43 years ago.
