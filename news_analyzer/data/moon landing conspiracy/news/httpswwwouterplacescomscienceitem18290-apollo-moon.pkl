VConspiracy Theorists Say This Rare Apollo 16 Photo Proves the Moon Landing Was Fake\u000a\u000aConspiracy theorists and skeptics have argued for the past five decades that man never stepped foot on the Moon. For every photo, video, or first-hand account to the contrary, there are a dozen or more rebuttals and analyses to expose the lies.\u000a\u000aOthers accept that the moon landing really happened, but say that the real cover-up is the known existence of and contact with aliens.\u000a\u000aRecently, supposedly un-doctored imagery from the Apollo 16 mission have been circulating online that some say is definitive proof that either there was an alien colony up there or the whole thing was filmed on a  because there are structures and "people" in the background.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aA video posted to the UFOmania YouTube channel analyzes an image from the NASA archives (Photo ID: AS16-106-17340).\u000a\u000aTaken on April 23, 1972 by Charles M. Duke, the photo is of Astronaut John W. Young collecting lunar samples with a rake and tongs in the foreground, but it's what is in the distance that caught the internet's attention. UFOmania claims that the blurry object is a "habitat building, spaceship, and extra personnel."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSubscribers shared their own theories about the image, with some commenting that Moon landings were filmed in remote locations, and others saying that the object is actually Darth Vader's house.\u000a\u000a"The moon landings were a hoax, it's laughable some people still believe in this fairytale," wrote another theorist.\u000a\u000a"Anyone who believes this crap has still got it in their head that we traveled 250k miles in the death vacuum of space....please space travel is ALL FAKE," wrote another.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOthers called bullshit on the pixelated images and the claims that it looks like a habitat and people.\u000a\u000a"Why distort the image to suit the narrative," wrote one non-believer. "Apollo 16 mission was film in glorious technicolor , what You see there is called a rock not a space habitat [sic]." Watch the analysis video below and check out the high res image to decide for yourself.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
