VYet, like redemption theory, Pizzagate was believable to some people because large-scale abuses and high-level cover-ups actually do happen. The events of the next year only confirmed this, when Harvey Weinstein was publicly outed as a serial predator whose decades of abuse were enabled by a network of associates. (\u201cIs Pizzagate all still fake?\u201d one speaker at the rally Merlan attended triumphantly asked in the wake of the Weinstein revelations.) Crank ideas, in other words, are often the proverbial stopped clocks, and conspiracy theories tend to gesture toward very real inequalities and abuses of power. \u201cAnyone who tells you we can always easily distinguish fictitious plots from real ones,\u201d Merlan writes, \u201cprobably hasn\u2019t read very much history.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis doesn\u2019t make conspiracy theories any less dangerous. Paranoid delusions provide the underpinnings of various extremist predilections and serve to encourage attacks on vulnerable groups. The far right has, for instance, despicably accused the victims of Sandy Hook and other mass shootings of being paid \u201ccrisis actors\u201d dispatched by the government as part of an elaborate scheme to confiscate citizens\u2019 guns; those accusations, spread via publications such as Infowars, have made the grieving families targets of vicious harassment. (Seth Rich\u2019s family also has endured constant threats and abuse.) The mass murderers Anders Breivik, Dylann Roof, and the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter Robert Bowers each subscribed to a number of racist and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.\u000a\u000aThe foundations of several of today\u2019s most noxious conspiracy theories were decades\u2014even centuries\u2014in the making. One early American conspiracy theory, propagated by religious officials in New England during the late eighteenth century, held that the Illuminati had orchestrated the French Revolution and were planning to import Jacobinism to the United States. The New England ministers\u2019 sermons against the Illuminati, which warned of their impending threat to an American \u201cway of life,\u201d helped set the blueprint for the next several eras of American conspiracism. (To this day, the short-lived Bavarian secret society remains a preoccupation of British conspiracy theorist David Icke, who contends that its members are giant lizards.)\u000a\u000aBy the beginning of the twentieth century, the fear of a surreptitious foreign influence on the American way of life had fused with anti-Semitism to form the backbone of many modern-day conspiracy theories: the idea of a \u201chidden hand\u201d or secret government made up of Jews that pulls the strings behind the scenes of national governments and other institutions. The longstanding belief that the Rothschild family controls every bank in the world is one such conspiracy theory descended from the \u201chidden hand\u201d theory; the idea that there exists a supra-national body bent on authoritarian global rule, often called the New World Order, is another. As Conspiracies of Conspiracies painstakingly demonstrates, this strand of anti-Semitism birthed, among other twentieth-century conspiracy theories, the belief that Jews had engineered the Russian Revolution, the New Deal, and the civil rights movement as part of an international communist conspiracy. (There\u2019s still no satisfying answer to how Jews managed to become both omnipotent international financiers\u2014the ur-capitalists\u2014and Bolsheviks.)\u000a\u000aConspiracy theories, both anti-Semitic and otherwise, tend to wax and wane with periods of social upheaval. During the 1930s, Konda writes, the \u201cworldwide economic depression, the rise of fascism, and the dramatic political shift into the New Deal\u201d spawned a host of hidden hand conspiracy theories, including the contention that FDR was a secret Jew, and that hundreds of thousands of Jewish communists were planning to enter the United States via the Mexico border to \u201crape every woman and child that is left unprotected.\u201d Similarly, the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal, followed by bombshell reports of government abuses in the 1970s, fostered a deep distrust of authority. That period saw conspiracy theories about John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination, moon landing denialism, and fears of a fictitious \u201cKing Alfred Plan,\u201d a CIA plot to round up African Americans and send them to concentration camps in the event of race riots.\u000a\u000aNearly every period of turmoil in American history has generated its own host of conspiracy theories. Is conspiracism in the Trump era really more widespread than it was in the 1920s, when Henry Ford printed and distributed 500,000 copies of the anti-Semitic tract Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, or during the McCarthy era, when hundreds were imprisoned and thousands more fired from their jobs or blacklisted on suspicion of harboring communist sympathies? Does the proliferation of 4chan threads dedicated to proving Hillary Clinton\u2019s involvement in a secret pedophilia ring signal a significant departure from the Satanic panic of the 1980s, when the media and the public alike became convinced that preschool teachers were sexually abusing toddlers as part of underground Satanic rituals? The problem with making an exhaustive catalog of the craziest theories entertained by Americans over the last 200 years is that today\u2019s almost seem to pale by comparison.\u000a\u000aExtinguishing conspiratorial tendencies that plainly surface again and again will require more than just the public\u2019s awareness that those tendencies exist. This is where short-term solutions to righting \u201cpost-truth\u201d notions often falter. The media\u2019s rigorous fact-checking of politicians\u2019 statements does help sometimes, but its effects do not tend to last. Public trust in both the federal government and the media is now at a record low, which means that news campaigns designed to correct falsehoods, like The Washington Post\u2019s Pinocchio system, are likely to have diminishing returns. And as Scientific American recently reported, the collapse of local newspapers has exacerbated political polarization, as citizens increasingly rely on national coverage, which prioritizes partisan talking heads and emphasizes political differences.\u000a\u000aA vast number of conspiracy theories hinge on the existence of a subjugated yet honorable \u201cpeople\u201d against a corrupt and scheming \u201celite,\u201d and, as it happens, so does populism. That conspiracism and populism are often found together probably comes as no surprise to anyone who has paid attention to Donald Trump\u2019s supporters in any detail. But it does suggest that fighting conspiracy theories will mean understanding and taking seriously the causes of the rise of populism in the United States and Europe over the last few years. Addressing the conditions that enable conspiracism, rather than the content of the conspiracism itself, points the way toward quashing it. In Merlan\u2019s view, real and permanent solutions will include \u201cgenuinely representative elections, better education in science and media literacy, a less moneyed system of democracy, true and permanent government transparency.\u201d\u000a\u000aA March 2019 report from the Pew Research Center revealed that the majority of Americans now believe that their living conditions will continue to decline over the next three decades, including a widening gap between the rich and poor; the ongoing erosion of stable, well-paying work; and increasing political animosity. A large portion of the public foresees a weaker economy, more expensive health care, environmental degradation, and a difficult old age. Such prospects don\u2019t bode well for the future of factuality.\u000a\u000a\u201cConspiracy theories are for losers,\u201d the political scientists Joseph Uscinski and Joseph Parent once wrote. They meant literal losers: people who have lost elections and culture wars, but also jobs, homes, and economic prospects. Without a serious political and economic realignment in the next few years, that group will only include more and more of us.
