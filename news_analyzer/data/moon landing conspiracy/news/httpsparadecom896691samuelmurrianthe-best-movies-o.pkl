VThis has been a downright splendid year for movies. So much so, in fact, that a midyear top 10 just wasn\u2019t going to cut it.\u000a\u000aWe\u2019ve rounded up and ranked the 15 best films released in the first six months of 2019. Of note on this list: several illuminating documentaries, a mega-hit horror movie for the ages, a few musicals and a game-changing teen comedy.\u000a\u000aIn ascending order, here is our ranking of the best movies of 2019, so far. We\u2019ve even included some honorable mentions.\u000a\u000aThe relentlessly paced third entry in the saga of a deadly hitman with a soft spot for dogs cements Keanu Reeves as one of the greatest action stars in history. Parabellum starts too feel a little too slight on narrative\u2013even for a shoot \u2019em up\u2013 in its third act, but if the narrative can be freshened up enough to keep up with the envelope-pushing, often awe-inspiring combat set pieces, this series could run for another 10 years.\u000a\u000aRelated: Here\u2019s Why We Think Marvel Should Cast Keanu Reeves As Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four\u000a\u000aSimilar to the Eugene O\u2019Neill play in name only, 30-year-old Chinese director Bi Gan\u2018s second feature is a neo-noir about regret, romance, and the passing of time. Around the halfway mark, it switches from 2D to 3D\u2013one extended 59-minute 3D unbroken take. Technically, this has a wow factor that you could even compare to Roma\u2018s, though it never feels self-conscious the way Roma sometimes did. A massive success in China\u2013even with young audiences\u2013this is a rush of pure cinema, an intoxicating fever dream.\u000a\u000aA master of understatement with incredible presence, Matthias Schoenaerts has always stood out. His raw, tender performance as a violent convict in The Mustang is worthy of awards recognition. This powerful, gritty and authentic drama co-stars Connie Britton and Bruce Dern. Executive-produced by Robert Redford, it\u2019s inspired by the real-life Wild Horse Inmate Program.\u000a\u000aJulianne Moore captivates and enthralls as an independent-minded divorcée looking for love in Sebastián Lelio\u2018s remake of his own acclaimed Spanish-language drama film. This film largely rests on Moore\u2019s shoulders, but it\u2019s important to note Lelio\u2019s remarkable track record. He\u2019s seamlessly made the jump to American cinema; his Oscar-winning A Fantastic Woman stands out as his very best work to date.\u000a\u000aIt doesn\u2019t match the scorching, bruising emotions of Toy Story 3, and it\u2019s not as LOL-funny throughout as part two, but this is still another win for Pixar. As always, this series asks deeper questions about abandonment, selflessness and the need to be loved than most Oscar-bait prestige dramas could in their wildest dreams.\u000a\u000aThere are so many superhero movies out there right now. So what makes Shazam! head-and-shoulders above most of them? For one, it\u2019s the enormous heart it wears on its sleeve. David F. Sandberg\u2018s critically acclaimed addition to the DCEU is all about the importance of family, even the family you make.\u000a\u000aAnd then there\u2019s the relentlessly irreverent humor. It\u2019s like fourteen-year-old boys actually wrote the script, in the best possible way. There\u2019s exciting action and even some red-blooded horror here, too. Shazam! is a winning delight.\u000a\u000aEspecially when seen on an IMAX screen, this documentary is more stunning and immersive than special effects-heavy spectacles like First Man and Gravity. It\u2019s a glorious, rip-roaring way to celebrate the anniversary of mankind\u2019s giant leap, and would make for a practical summer viewing assignment for moon-landing conspiracy theorists.\u000a\u000aRelated: It\u2019s the 50th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon Landing! Celebrating Mankind\u2019s Giant Leap\u000a\u000aJoanna Hogg\u2018s exquisitely realized, semi-autobiographical drama is all about the lasting effects, good and bad, of an unhealthy romance. Honor Swinton Byrne, Tom Burke and Tilda Swinton star in this American-British production that received universal critical acclaim. A sequel, The Souvenir Part II, has been announced.\u000a\u000aWith the staggering financial and critical success of Us, Oscar-winning Get Out helmer Jordan Peele is officially a multiplex auteur whose name can open a movie, comparably to Christopher Nolan and Steven Spielberg. The twisty, gory, profoundly American and surprisingly frightening thriller is more than a worthy sophomore outing, and it gets better with repeat viewings. Lupita Nyong\u2019o deserves consideration come Oscar season.\u000a\u000aFollowing the relative meh of Captain Marvel, the final installment of Marvel\u2019s \u201cInfinity Saga,\u201d Endgame is so good, so complete and satisfying, it makes Infinity War retroactively even better. Combined, they\u2019re a landmark moment for not just the superhero genre, but popcorn entertainment at large.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not a spoiler to say that the final shot of Endgame was a big creative risk. It paid off, big time. Who knew a movie this huge could feel quite so intimate?\u000a\u000aRelated: 5 Reasons Avengers: Endgame Could Become the Biggest Movie of All Time\u000a\u000aSad, sometimes deeply funny, always impeccably composed, director Joe Talbot\u2018s debut feature, about gentrification in the City by the Bay, is uniquely, wondrously gorgeous to behold. We can\u2019t say enough nice things about the music and cinematography, both among the year\u2019s best. Few movies you\u2019ll see in 2019 possess the power to haunt quite like this.\u000a\u000aBohemian Rhapsody was overcommitted to recreating some things on a technical level. Rocketman really, truly feels the music. Dexter Fletcher\u2018s Elton John biopic is a splashy old-fashioned musical, a juicy showbiz melodrama, and one of the most affecting movies about sobering up in recent memory. It all wouldn\u2019t work without Taron Egerton, who is now one of the most versatile and well-liked young actors working in popular films.\u000a\u000aRocketman can\u2019t get bogged down by the clichés that commonly burden biopics, because\u2013to be perfectly accurate here\u2013 it dances all over them. What a triumph this is.\u000a\u000aRelated: Taron Egerton Reveals How Elton John Helped Him Prepare for Rocketman, What He Found Reading His Diaries and More\u000a\u000aA star is born feels like a sheepish understatement when the topic at hand is Jessie Buckley, whose turn as Glasgow girl with her heart in country music is one of the year\u2019s best performances by any measurement. Wild Rose will make you laugh, and it will move you to tears. It will lift you up, and it will give you an even deeper appreciation for one of the great American art forms.\u000a\u000aRelated: Jesse Buckley Talks Country Music and Why There\u2019s No Place Like Nashville\u000a\u000aDocumentaries have been great this year. As we\u2019ve said, we were over-the-moon for Apollo 11. We were inspired by The Biggest Little Farm. Netflix\u2019s Knock Down the House was a knockout. Martin Scorsese\u2018s Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story has been widely praised. But who could possibly top The Queen of Soul?\u000a\u000aPure and simple, Amazing Grace is as much a spiritual experience as it is a movie. An electrifying account of Aretha Franklin\u2018s famed 1972 concert with the Southern California Community Choir, Sydney Pollack\u2018s decades-delayed doc proves all you need is a few cameras and one of the greatest voices in history to make essential viewing. Unforgettable.\u000a\u000aEven in a golden age of coming-of-age pictures (see: Love, Simon, Eighth Grade, The Miseducation of Cameron Post)  Olivia Wilde\u2018s magnificent, howlingly funny directorial debut stands out. You\u2019ll never see a film that more perfectly captures intelligent contemporary high school students: how they talk, what their rooms look like, their embarrassing parents, things like that. With no shortage of heart to match the humor, this can comfortably be called one of the best teen movies ever made.\u000a\u000aTwitter lost its mind\u2013justifiably\u2013last week, when Booksmart got a social-media wink from none other than Malala Yousafzai.  Everything in and surrounding this movie is pure joy and hope.\u000a\u000aRelated: 5 Reasons Booksmart is One of the Best Teen Movies Ever\u000a\u000aHonorable mentions: Fighting With My Family (featuring a sensational turn by the ever-magnetic Florence Pugh), Little Woods, Blowin\u2019 Up, Transit, Diane and High Life.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s the best movie you\u2019ve seen in 2019? Think we missed one here? Let us know in the comments!
