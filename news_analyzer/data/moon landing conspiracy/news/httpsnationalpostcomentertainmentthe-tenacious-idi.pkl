VIt is the summer of 1969. The world\u2019s attention is skyward: toward the moon, where Apollo 11 approaches its epoch-making destiny. But in a house on the beach off the coast of central California broods a man who knows better than to care. His name is Bill Kaysing. He is a former technical writer at Rocketdyne, the company that built the spacecraft\u2019s main propulsion units.\u000a\u000aKaysing has a hunch. It will eventually manifest as a suspicion, and then mutate into one of the most pervasive and insidious conspiracy theories of all time. Kaysing will write a book on the subject. Rather he will write the book \u2014 the primary text, outlining his every intuition, misgiving and doubt about the moon landing.\u000a\u000aAmong common conspiracy theories, the moon landing is the most tenacious. It has a long and pervasive history: no matter the volume of proof, no matter the ease with which it can be further substantiated, otherwise reasonable men and women continue to affirm their incredulity. They insist that radiation from the Van Allen belt between Earth and the moon would make a safe trip between the two physically impossible. They say solar flares and solar winds would have destroyed any spacecraft making an attempt. They claim surface temperatures on the lunar surface by day would have cooked the astronauts alive in their suits, or as least spoiled a camera film. They argue transmissions of sound or video from such an extraordinary distance could not have come through so quickly or so clearly. They contend the failed and thwarted efforts of the Gemini and early Apollo missions demonstrate a basic incompetence it would have been impossible for NASA in a matter of months to overcome.\u000a\u000aAnd so on. None of these contentions has any basis in scientific fact. Indeed, it\u2019s essential to such arguments that they run contrary to the scientific method at large. After all, what\u2019s a fancy explanation from scientists really worth? Scientists: the very people who orchestrated this elaborate scheme.\u000a\u000aSomeone who truly believes the moon landing was a conspiracy and a hoax perpetrated by NASA and the United States government cannot be dissuaded from this belief by reason alone. Try explaining to the conspiracy theorist that, for instance, the moon landing took place in the early hours of dawn when temperatures are much cooler, or that there were no solar flares during the times of the Apollo voyages, or that the aluminum hull of the Apollo spacecraft was designed to insulate the astronauts against radiation of the kind one might find in the Van Allen belt, and the facts will fall on deaf ears.\u000a\u000aPart of the reason the moon landing has been a matter of such particular fascination (and fixation) for such men and women is the apparent truth it demonstrates about the government on a world-historical scale. To the ardent conspiracy theorist, the government is capable of anything \u2014 except, of course, sending men to the moon.\u000a\u000aKaysing\u2019s opus, We Never Went to the Moon: America\u2019s Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle, which features chapters such as \u201cElements of Rocket Propulsion\u201d and \u201cWere the Astronauts Manchurian Candidates,\u201d describes his personal apprehensions about the veracity of the project: \u201cWhy, of all people, shouldn\u2019t I be captivated with the prospect of seeing the fruition of my work and the labours of thousands of others who had contributed to the Apollo voyage programs?\u201d he wonders. \u201cSomehow I seemed to have perceived that the Apollo project had become a gigantic hoax and that nobody was leaving earth for the moon, certainly not in July of 1969.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe begins with skepticism and proceeds to confirm his own disbeliefs. Kaysing\u2019s book represents what he calls \u201can invitation to NASA or other groups or concerned individuals to review the concept present and refute it with some indisputable evidence that we have, indeed, landed on the moon.\u201d Of course, evidence such as \u201cphotos\u201d or \u201csuperficial items\u201d will not suffice to satisfy his dubious mind.\u000a\u000aWhy did astronauts seem to score attractive jobs following their return? Why did various other astronauts, those whose launch attempts failed, wind up conveniently dead? And why did we never hear about gold or silver or diamonds on the moon? The questions tormenting such doubters \u201chave never been satisfactorily answered by NASA,\u201d Kaysing argues.\u000a\u000aSurely we have all, at some time or another, pondered these mysteries. Only Kaysing seeks at last to solve them: \u201cRecognizing that ASP officials would cover their tracks as effectively as the CIA agents who concealed the murderers of President Kennedy,\u201d he explains sensibly enough when introducing his original research, \u201cthe author made an unusual effort to find clues that would indicate that a simulation had, in fact, taken place.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe effort was certainly unusual. On page 21, he presents a facsimile of a well-known photograph of the lunar surface, the black of outer space cresting up beyond the horizon behind. It bears a terse caption: \u201cWhere are the STARS?\u201d Yes, it was foolish of NASA\u2019s counterfeiters to have left stars out of what Kaysing concludes is an obvious composite. Were these photos as fraudulent as he maintains, and had they included whatever details whose absence he cites as clinching proof of their fraudulence, Kaysing would chalk the added touches up to NASA\u2019s fastidiousness. Photos can be faked. So, of course, they must be.\u000a\u000a\u201cLook closely at both of these purported moon landing shots,\u201d Kaysing writes above a straightforward pair of moon pictures pasted side by side. Most of his proof has this same tone of self-appointed expertise: don\u2019t trust the word of NASA; your own eyes can see the truth. It is enough that something merely seems true.\u000a\u000aSkeptics like Kaysing are not persuaded by photographs or live broadcasts or even by the rocks that were brought back to Earth from the moon. How can evidence compete with instinct? How can images of the real moon convince you it\u2019s not a sound stage? If one feels according to one\u2019s gut that, say, the shadows cast across the lunar surface by the landing module ought to be pointed another direction, or that the landing module ought to have created a blast crater that should have been visible in pictures of the craft, that counts for more to the obstinate conspiracy theorist than easily manipulable trivialities such as \u201cfacts.\u201d\u000a\u000aOne simply has to look for potential motivation: NASA was ashamed of the $30 billion it had invested in the project without result; some impatient and powerful politicians were embarrassed that the Soviet Union had continued to outpace their progress in the space race; the president was desperate to distract an aggrieved public from its dissent toward the Vietnam war. Always the same nefarious machinations of the powers that be, whatever explanation the theorist chooses specifically to believe. The point, ultimately, seems to be to pull the wool over the eyes of an impressionable populace. It is the theorist alone who sees the secret truth \u2014 and can tell the rest of us \u201csheeple\u201d to wake up to it.\u000a\u000aLike most conspiracies of this scale, a non-factual counter-argument can be made that it is difficult to imagine so many people preserving the fiction: thousands worked on the Apollo missions; hundreds were responsible for the launch and the landing and were eyewitnesses to its success; most especially, three men were actually in space, two of them on the surface of the moon. So incredible would the feat of faking the moon landing and keeping the reality of the hoax a secret for half a century, that it barely seems worth the effort. It would have been easier to just land on the moon.\u000a\u000aWell, conspiracy theorists have an explanation for the breadth of the subterfuge, too. They point to the many other historical instances of government deception \u2014 the fact that we know of them because they were at some point exposed or confessed does not seem to trouble them.\u000a\u000aIt is the nature of the conspiracy theory to doubt reason and favour feeling. A hunch can be seductive; a hunch was all it took for Kaysing to disregard the transmissions beamed into what he calls his \u201cboob tube,\u201d and to pursue on the strength of his inexplicable conviction the proof necessary to make vague suspicions look like certain truth.\u000a\u000aCasting doubt on photographs of the moon because they seem to you to contain errors or contradictions is a handy way to feel superior to the benighted masses who accept whatever happens to be presented to them by the representatives of the status quo. And it\u2019s less work for the layman to doubt by sight or intuition than to actually investigate these claims or learn anything concrete about the facts.\u000a\u000aHow space travel works is complicated. It is literally rocket science.
