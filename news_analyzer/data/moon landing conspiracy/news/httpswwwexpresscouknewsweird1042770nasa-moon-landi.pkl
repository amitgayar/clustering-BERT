VConspiracy theorists have challenged NASA\u2019s 1969 Moon landing story after claiming Neil Armstrong\u2019s iconic footprint does not match the sole of his lunar boots. On July 20, 1969, Mr Armstrong took one small step for man and firmly planted his feet in the grey, dusty surface of the Moon. An iconic photograph of the very first steps on the Moon was forever captured by fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin and the footprints will remain on the windless Moon for millions of years. The monumental Apollo 11 achievement marked a new age in human exploration but critics worldwide accused NASA of foul play.\u000a\u000aConspiracists have now claimed a photograph of Neil Armstrong\u2019s spacesuit taken in 2016, is the final piece of evidence needed to disprove NASA\u2019s Moon landing. The photograph taken by astronomer Phil Plait in the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum shows Mr Armstrong\u2019s historic spacesuit from the Apollo 11 mission. Eagle-eyed conspiracists were quick to point out the soles on the spacesuit\u2019s boots are flat an smooth without any grooves. The footprint left behind on the Moon, however, shows an imprint of a sole with thick perpendicular treads.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are also a few photos of the boots that also confirm this.\u201d There is, however, ample evidence to debunk the conspiracy claim and show that NASA\u2019s astronauts did indeed set foot on the Moon. Firstly the photos in question is of Mr Aldrin\u2019s footprint, not of Mr Armstrong\u2019s.

As he hopped around in the low-gravity environment the astronaut took a number of photographs of his footprints. The second piece of the puzzle debunking the conspiracy claim is the actual gear both astronauts wore to the Moon. A breakdown of the astronauts\u2019 spacesuits shows they wore a kind of protective overshoe on top of their boots once they stepped out onto the Moon. READ MORE: Was the moon landing FAKED? David Meade weighs in on NASA Apollo 11 hoax claims\u000a\u000aThese overshoes are much thicker and bigger and feature pronounced treads like the ones in the footprint photo. A single photo of Mr Armstrong\u2019s feet on the Moon shows him wearing these exact overboots on top of his spacesuit. A plaque from the Frontiers of Flight Museum in Texas, featured next to the piece of equipment, reads: \u201cOvershoe, Lunar \u2013 Left, Training. \u201cThis overshoe went over the regular boot area on the spacesuit version used on the Moon, called the A7LB Space Suit. \u201cThe shoe provides extra protection from rips, tears, and dust to the basic space suit.
