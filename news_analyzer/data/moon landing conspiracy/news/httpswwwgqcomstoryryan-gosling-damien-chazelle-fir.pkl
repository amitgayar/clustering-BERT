VIndeed, one can't help walking away from First Man with a trenchant longing, almost a stomach stitch, caused by the scale of the collective pursuit, the bigness of the dream, and, by contrast, the modesty of one's own ambitions, the limpness of one's own personal stakes. The enduring impression, of course, is that the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo missions made\u2014for all mankind\u2014the impossible suddenly seem possible. But when you consider the men who did the \ufb02ying, these pilots, these \ufb01ghter jocks with their "sinfully inconfessable feeling of superiority," as Wolfe once put it, these allegedly mortal men with their extra little sizzle, they also sort of ruined the lives of many other men and women for years, who couldn't quite believe what they'd witnessed, and couldn't quite imagine taking it to the limit in quite as delicious a manner ever again.\u000a\u000aThey were great \ufb02iers, among the best, but they were human beings, too. They were the last cowboys, in all the greatest and most terrible ways. And they set the bar for the past 60 American years for speed, for thrills, for discovery, for glory, and for purpose well beyond one's own happily, if humbly, constrained life. They weren't gods, but they sure did fuck some people up with the shit they pulled off.\u000a\u000aEngineering, technology, even aerospace would advance, but the second half of the 20th century would turn that progress inward, into computers and watches and phones, the new moon shot being a virtual marketplace that can deliver cat food and scissors overnight, and in the same box. Humanity-shifting endeavors, no doubt. But doesn't exactly shake the soul like a Saturn V rocket launch, does it?\u000a\u000a"What is it\u2026that makes a man willing to sit up on top of an enormous Roman candle\u2026and wait for someone to light the fuse?" Wolfe wrote\u2014the question that animated his book, but also our collective obsession.\u000a\u000aThis \ufb01lm gets back to those sorts of places, to those impossible encounters with audacity, and our frayed wires of comprehension.\u000a\u000aIt's what Chazelle means when he says we still haven't fully processed the implications of what was achieved.\u000a\u000aHow did they do it? How did we do it? Truly?\u000a\u000a"It feels like anytime you make a space movie, eventually you come face-to-face with 2001," Chazelle says. "And every space movie since then really is a child of 2001, whether it wants to be or not."\u000a\u000aThis is how Damien Chazelle talks about movies. With an encyclopedic baseline and a professor's facility for the family tree of all \ufb01lm, the arrows of in\ufb02uence in multiple directions, the living conversation between \ufb01lms past and present. He knows what he wants a shot to look and feel and sound like and, equally important, what it should not look and feel and sound like\u2014all those references.\u000a\u000aIn this way, he seems older than his years. Which can probably be explained by the fact that this is a 33-year-old who, in all the most essential ways, has been making First Man (and La La Land, and Whiplash, and Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench before that) since he was a kid. A little bit, at least, every day. Every free hour of every evening growing up, he says, he would be shooting with his father's camcorder, writing scripts, studying \ufb01lms he barely understood, drawing storyboards for movies that would never be made. "I was so movie-obsessed that everything revolved around that," he says. "I would try to get my schoolwork done as soon as possible so that I could just think about movies." (He spent an additional seemingly 50 hours a day becoming a jazz drummer\u2014the whole Whiplash thing\u2014and earning the grades to get into Harvard.)
