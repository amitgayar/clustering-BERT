VOn July 20, 1969, NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first man on the Moon. The now-iconic event is viewed as a prime example of the good mankind is capable of. However, on the eve of the Apollo 11 Moon landing fiftieth anniversary approaches, a cable of conspiracy theorists stubbornly refuse to belief the Moon landing truth.\u000a\u000aNASA astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins faced great sacrifice for the sake of pushing the frontiers of science, technology and human endeavour forward. Embarking on the craft with \u201ca very limited set of objectives\u201d, the NASA mission was really \u201ca test run\u201d to see if mankind could reach the Moon. Sir Charles Shults III was recently invited to address key aspects used by Moon landing naysayers on the Coast To Coast radio show.\u000a\u000aThe broadcast Moon landing footage was filmed in a studio: Sir Charles Shults III, a respected aerospace engineer with several decades experience, believes that although there was the potential for forgery to exist, it would be too difficult to make it realistic. Sir Shults said: \u201cThere are many details that forgers could not possibly have got right in a recreation. \u201cThink about prep to watch a movie these days and pick apart every frame for inconsistencies. \u201cAnd you can see it would be very difficult to fake something in a studio that would match what was going on. \u201cAnd on top of that a huge bulk 8,400 photographs has just been released by NASA, that would make it extremely impossible if not impossible to fake.\u201d\u000a\u000aSir Shults said points out how NASA scientists were well aware that without any atmosphere the flag had no way of fluttering \u2013 it would simply hang limply. He said: \u201cThe scientists put a springy wire at the edge of the flag to hold the fabric out. \u201cAnd because there is no air, that is why the flag continued to move after the flag was planted. \u201cThe spring had nothing to slow its movements down, as it is was in a vacuum. \u201cAnd if you look at the footage where the lunar landed lifts off at the end of the mission, you will see the rocket exhaust definitely move the flag, that was standing still only moments before.\u201d READ MORE: Hunt for aliens \u2018only just BEGINNING\u2019 says top scientist\u000a\u000aSome sceptics point out that in order to get to the Moon, it requires passing through the Van Allen radiation belt, both there and on the trip back. Sir Shults however points out this argument is based on a poor understanding of physics. He said: \u201cPeople do not have a lot information about physics, and they don\u2019t know what the intensity of radiation is. \u201cThe astronauts take around four hours to pass through the Van Allen belts. \u201cAnd the total amount of radiation they would pick up is approximate to receiving a chest X-ray.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo it is not a life-threatening amount of radiation, as it is not a place they have to spent a lot of time. And to prove this point, three astronauts actually went to the Moon twice. Sir Shults said: \u201cJames Lovell went to orbit the Moon in 1968 and went back for another pass on Apollo 13. \u201cSo he went through the Van Allen belt four times. \u201cIt was soon found to make the capsules of very light-weight materials that allowed the radiations to pass right through the astronauts, without generating secondary and tertiary radiation.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is no cloud coverage, so astronauts are being hit with raw sunlight. However the NASA spacesuits were insulated and they also contained air conditioning layers. \u201cThe astronauts did not get cooked because because they had the proper equipment to keep the alive. \u201cThe equipment was also well insulated, and during the early missions, you will notice the shielding on the cameras is something very thick, and they didn\u2019t allow it to the exposed to direct sunlight for much of the time. \u201cAnd another defence against that intensity of heat was to keep the equipment under something as simple as a shade or an awning.\u201d
