VCreated in 1991, the Amgen Foundation is the philanthropic arm of Amgen Inc., one of the world's leading independent biotechnology companies. Amgen is legendary for its profitability, its large cash reserves and its red-hot stock, which has nearly quadrupled in value in the past decade. These riches have helped underwrite an active foundation that \u201cseeks to advance excellence in science education to inspire the next generation of innovators, and invest in strengthening communities where Amgen staff members live and work.\u201d To date, the foundation has contributed more than $300 million to local, regional and international nonprofit organizations that reflect Amgen\u2019s core values, and has contributed nearly $150 million to advancing science education programming globally.\u000a\u000aAmgen Foundation runs a range of programs, and I recently sat down with Eduardo Cetlin, Amgen Foundation president, and executive director of philanthropy and responsibility at Amgen Inc., at this year\u2019s Social Innovation Summit in Los Angeles to find out more about the foundation\u2019s layered work. In the process, I learned about many of the foundation\u2019s core activities, and what\u2019s down the line for this corporate funder in a science education space that\u2019s been attracting a lot of philanthropic attention lately.\u000a\u000aBrazilian-born Cetlin began by telling me a little bit about Amgen Inc. itself. Founded in 1980, 40 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles in Thousand Oaks, Cetlin says the company exists to serve patients and tackle the painful diseases that wreak havoc on patients and their families. A part of Amgen\u2019s philanthropy reflects that mission, and Cetlin oversees an assistance program that distributes medicine and supplies. Last year, for example, Cetlin says Amgen donated more than $90 million worth of cancer medication via Direct Relief in Santa Barbara for 6,000 to 7,000 patients in 18 developing countries.\u000a\u000aBut like a lot of companies these days, especially in the tech and pharma sectors, Amgen is worried about education and the quality of tomorrow\u2019s workforce\u2014a concern that\u2019s a central driver of the foundation\u2019s work. \u201cIf society doesn\u2019t understand how science works, we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d Cetlin begins. \u201cHow is it possible that we\u2019re seriously thinking about how to cure cancer and making progress on the one hand, with some believing in, say, moon landing conspiracy theories on the other? Our education system is stuck in the last century. We need to foster students who understand how the world works, how to question it, and how to navigate it successfully.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo that end, the Amgen Foundation operates on two fronts. It works to empower science teachers, which Cetlin calls the secret ingredient, and it also works with science students. The foundation\u2019s Amgen Biotech Experience (ABE) collaborates with \u201cleadership from university and other partners\u201d to give \u201cteacher professional development, teaching materials, and research-grade lab equipment to high schools.\u201d This flagship program dates back some three decades, when two friends, a teacher from Newbury Park High School and a young Amgen scientist, started to talk about bringing some of Amgen\u2019s techniques to the classroom.\u000a\u000aCetlin says, \u201cWe train the teacher, bring them to a training session together with a bunch of other teachers, where they get to be a student again, and say, \u2018I don\u2019t get this\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m having trouble with that.\u2019 And we provide professional-grade equipment. Some people have been for the program for more than 20 years, and we really see a multiplier effect with its impact on thousands of students.\u201d\u000a\u000aTraining typically happens during the summer, with between 1,000 and 1,200 teachers participating at any given time. Cetlin says Amgen currently reaches about 80,000 students a year through the program, which works in Southern California and other places where Amgen has a presence, including Boston and Puerto Rico.\u000a\u000aAnother major program, Amgen Scholars, offers \u201ccutting-edge research experiences and exposure to biotechnology and drug discovery\u201d to undergraduate students at select universities in the U.S., Europe, Asia, Canada and Australia. \u201cThey have the opportunity to act like scientists in the classroom. Every scientist starts with a question. This is what we need to enable our students to do,\u201d Cetlin says.\u000a\u000aAmgen Scholars offers undergraduate research opportunities at 24 institutions. Out of more than 5,500 applicants at more than 1,200 colleges, 360 students are selected to do summer research. Amgen provides financial resources, including a stipend, which includes airfare and room and board. The program also includes a symposium, where scholars connect and meet actual scientists. Scholars also visit Amgen headquarters. And as far as impact, Cetlin says that Amgen Scholars are \u201cnow faculty or running their own labs. They\u2019re really all over their scientific careers, working in industry and academics.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt the helm of Amgen Foundation, Cetlin thinks a lot about questions of scale and impact, aiming to transform science education beyond the reach of Amgen BioTech Experience and Amgen Scholars. To that end, Cetlin reached out to Khan Academy, the nonprofit educational organization headquartered in the Bay Area, with the hope of creating biology programming. These talks eventually resulted in a one-year pilot and a three-year grant to Khan Academy, which developed an entire curriculum related to biology.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat they did first in math, now they have done in biology,\u201d Cetlin explains, jazzed about the power of technology to step in for these teachers: \u201cA textbook is updated every three to five years, and is expensive. In our partnership with Khan, we\u2019ve also helped empower teachers to determine how curriculum is utilized. There\u2019s an analytics factor here where I, as a teacher, can monitor student progress, and see the exact moment where he or she got stuck.\u201d\u000a\u000aSimilarly, Cetlin also tells me about a new program on the horizon, LabXchange, set to launch this fall. Grabbing a napkin and mapping out the nascent program in front of me in a frenzy, Cetlin talks about bringing together top-tier content from sources like edX in the form of online learning assets\u2014videos, assessments and simulations\u2014 to create a digital platform serving science educators, students and researchers. LabXchange\u2019s re-engineered Open edX platform will give users the flexibility to search, select and insert these assets into new learning pathways.\u000a\u000aIf they\u2019re successful, Cetlin believes that LabXchange will be the \u201cgo-to place for biology content,\u201d adding, \u201cWe\u2019re going to stagger the individual assets across a universe and organize them into pieces. A lecture, a video, a graph, a new article from a technical magazine so you can mix and match. Then, behind the scenes, quantitative experts at Harvard will vet the content. Now biology teachers have tons of information to make their own choices. Now you have the ability to show your students what\u2019s happening in real life and how they can use this content. If this works, if it\u2019s powerful as we think it\u2019s going to be, we\u2019ll start to level the playing field.\u201d\u000a\u000aCetlin is also excited about the leadership that steers LabXchange, including Robert Lue, faculty director and principal investigator. A Harvard professor of molecular and cellular biology, Lue also founded HarvardX, \u201ca University-wide strategic initiative to enable faculty to build and create open online learning experiences for residential and online use, and to enable groundbreaking research in online pedagogies.\u201d\u000a\u000aOf the use of technology in science education, Cetlin couldn\u2019t be more sold: \u201cKhan is really doing some powerful things, and I love its simplicity. You watch a video and learn. They\u2019re even having students take courses during free periods. The opportunities are endless.\u201d\u000a\u000aGiven the many tentacles of Amgen\u2019s philanthropy, Cetlin surprised me when he told me the foundation has a team of precisely \u201c3.5 people.\u201d A critical ally for Amgen through the years has been Educational Development Center (EDC) in Boston, which \u201cdesigns and delivers programs in education, health, and economic opportunity that provide life-changing opportunities to those who need them most.\u201d The Amgen Biotech Experience Program Office is based at EDC, providing technical assistance, developing resources, and supporting program sites and participating teachers. Returning to his napkin, Cetlin explains that EDC works with some 20 institutions including Harvard and Berkeley. \u201cFrom project director, to distribution center, to individual teacher, it takes a village.\u201d\u000a\u000aBefore we ended our conversation, Cetlin also told me about Woodrow Wilson Academy for Teaching and Learning (WW Academy), which, in collaboration with MIT, aims to reinvent American teacher preparation. Amgen is among WW Academy\u2019s funders, along with the likes of the Zuckerberg Chan Initiative, the Bezos Family Foundation, and the Simons Foundation. \u201cWho says four years is enough to teach teachers to be teachers? What does he or she need to be successful? How do you deal with school bureaucracy? WW Academy is thinking about the actual clinical practice of teaching, and how to make sure teachers be better prepared for what comes ahead.\u201d\u000a\u000aUltimately, Cetlin makes a distinction between the world of school and world of work, and the importance of connecting the two\u2014not unlike that Amgen scientist and high school science teacher who launched Amgen Biotech Experience many years ago: \u201cWe need to be getting the world of work to talk to the world of education, and vice versa. And from there, this won\u2019t just benefit Amgen, but our entire industry, and society at large.\u201d
