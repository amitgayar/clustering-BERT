VThis Morning oversaw a rather bizarre debate earlier today (August 1) after welcoming a moon landing conspiracy theorist.\u000a\u000aEamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford put Martin Kenny, who believes the moon landings were a hoax, against scientist Dr Sarah Bosman, after a survey found a majority of young people believe they were faked.\u000a\u000aMartin argued that there was "overwhelming proof" that they were faked, suggesting that modern technology has allowed people to scrutinise it more.\u000a\u000aHowever, Ruth noted that it would be impossible to get the many people involved in the moon landings to cover it up, with Sarah agreeing and noting that there were "thousands of people involved in the development of a rocket".\u000a\u000aStill, Martin was having none of it, at one point hitting back at Sarah as she tried to interject while he was talking, saying: "Let me finish."\u000a\u000aSarah also debunked the argument as to why no-one has been back since the 1970s, noting that there had been government funding cuts.\u000a\u000aMartin claimed his "smoking gun" was how data proving that man had been to the lunar surface was destroyed, though failed to produce any proof for his argument.\u000a\u000a"Some people think the moon's made of cheese," Eamonn later joked, though Martin stated his belief that the moon is not solid. Yes, really.\u000a\u000aSarah shook her head in disbelief, and it seemed viewers were doing the same:\u000a\u000aLater on, Eamonn cheekily noted: "Most of our lives are so boring that we want to believe."\u000a\u000aHowever, as Sarah looked at him, he added: "You've just given me one of those looks!" To be honest, we're so with her here.\u000a\u000aThis Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am.\u000a\u000aWant up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?
