VMoon landing experts who have intently studied the Apollo 11 mission have boldly claimed NASA is holding back information on what really happened on July 20, 1969. Shorty after the NASA lunar lander piloted by astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin touched down on the Moon, radio communications were cut short. Appearing on the History Channel\u2019s show Ancient Aliens, Dr Michael Salla, author of Exopolitics: Political Implications of the Extraterrestrial Presence, said the fact has been at the heart of a lot of intense debate. The NASA expert said: \u201cDuring the 1969 Apollo Moon mission, after the landing, there was a very strange gap in radio transmissions.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat happened in those two minutes has been subject to a lot of controversy.\u201d Over the years, NASA sceptics and conspiracy theorists have used the two minutes of radio silence to challenge NASA and claim humans never went to the Moon. Some scientists and NASA researchers have even gone as far as to claim NASA\u2019s astronauts came across evidence of alien activity on the Moon. One such researcher is book author David Childress, who said communiques of \u201cparked UFOs\u201d on the Moon were intercepted during this gap and withheld from the public.

Mr Bara, who also appeared on the History Channel, said both of NASA\u2019s astronauts were evidently upset by something they saw on the Moon within 30 minutes of landing. The revelation was made by a secret \u201cmedical\u201d channel of communication between Apollo 11 and NASA\u2019s mission control on Earth.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat channel was not public and it could have been very easily used to communicate information that you didn\u2019t want to be heard over the general public transmissions. \u201cWhat is really interesting about that story though, is the fact that within 30 minutes of landing on the Moon, that story was circulating around NASA that, hey guess what, they saw something on the rim of the crater, they were all upset, they didn\u2019t know what to do, they didn\u2019t know if they should go out.\u201d And David Whitehead, radio host and creator of the Truth Warrior podcast, argued the story is given credence by the astronaut\u2019s tense and sullen body language in post-return interviews. READ MORE: Does 'stagehand reflected in astronaut's' visor prove it was filmed in a studio?\u000a\u000aMr Whitehead said: \u201cIt is interesting when you watch the feed of when they came back from the Moon and they\u2019re not sitting there jumping up and down for joy and saying, \u2018I had the most incredible experience of my life, I was on the Moon\u2019. \u201cThey\u2019re not saying that. They look very sullen, very depressed, they\u2019re looking down. \u201cThey almost look like they want to vomit \u2013 that\u2019s how disturbed they look. \u201cCould they have seen something there that they didn\u2019t want to tell the public because of the implications?\u201d After the success of the Apollo 11, NASA sent six more manned crews to the Moon before public interest in lunar exploration waned.\u000a\u000aThe last astronaut to walk the Moon was Gene Cernan of the Apollo 17 mission \u2013 the 11th and final man to set foot on Earth\u2019s natural satellite. The fact NASA has not been back to the Moons since the Apollo Programme wrapped up has been another point of contention between conspiracy theorists and Moon landing sceptics alike. Alan Butler, author of Who Built the Moon?, said on Ancient Aliens: \u201cOne of the most interesting questions with regard to our interaction with the Moon, is why we have never gone back there since the end of the Apollo missions. \u201cAnd what else is very telling is that although the USSR at the time was getting to be quite able to send its own astronauts to the Moon, it never seems to have done so. \u201cCould it be that there were agencies associated with the Moon, aliens or other beings who have wanted humanity to stay away from the Moon?

VNASA\u2019S Apollo 11 crew achieved the first manned Moon landing in 1969 but there are some researchers who question whether NASA has told the entire truth about the landing. Here is what some believe happened during two mysterious minutes when Apollo 11 went radio-silent.
