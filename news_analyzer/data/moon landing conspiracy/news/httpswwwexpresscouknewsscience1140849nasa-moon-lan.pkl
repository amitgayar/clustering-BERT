VNASA landed the first two men on the Moon in 1969 after a decade of chasing the Soviet Union in the Cold War space race. America secured its victory on July 20, 1969, when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin \u201cBuzz\u201d Aldrin successfully touched down on the lunar orb. To mark the monumental achievement, the astronauts were instructed by President Richard Nixon to plant an American flag on the Moon in honour of every US taxpayer who contributed to the Apollo programme. However, the flag planting has attracted over the years an incredible amount of scrutiny and scepticism, leading conspiracy theorists to question whether NASA every really landed on the Moon.\u000a\u000aA leading conspiracy theory decrying NASA\u2019s achievement claims the US flag flapping around in the vacuum of space is evidence of the Moon landing being a hoax. When Commander Armstrong and Lunar Module pilot Buzz Aldrin planted the American flag, the red and white fabric appears to move as if it was in the wind. Mr Aldrin, who was photographed saluting the flag on the Moon, later said it was the \u201cproudest moment\u201d of his life. But if there is no atmosphere on the Moon, how could the flag wave around like that? This unusual moment, caught one of the Eagle Lunar Module cameras, has propped up 50 years worth of lunar conspiracies.

Highly unlikely because there is one key factor all lunar conspiracies get wrong and that is the American flag did not really flap or wave on the Moon. According to the UK National Space Centre in Leicester, the flag\u2019s apparent movements were caused by the astronauts themselves and not wind.\u000a\u000aThe Space Centre explained: \u201cThe flag was disturbed as it was planted into the ground and kept this bent shape because of the lack of strong gravity on the Moon. \u201cIn video footage of the flag being planted into the Moon\u2019s surface, it also appears to wave back and forth. \u201cThis is because when astronauts were planting it, they rotated it back and forth to better dig into the lunar soil, which of course made the flag ripple like a pendulum \u2013 without a breeze. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of footage of the flags stood on the Moon in exactly the same position.\u201d By simply comparing photos of the Moon snapped after the flag was planted, you will see the astronauts moving around but the flag remains in the exact same position. READ MORE: Moon hoax theorist 'under attack' for 'exposing truth' about lunar landings\u000a\u000aNASA itself addressed the hoax accusations, saying: \u201cNot every flag needs a breeze \u2013 at least not in space. \u201cWhen astronauts were planting the flagpole they rotated it back and forth to better penetrate the lunar soil \u2013 anyone who\u2019s set a blunt tent-post will know how this works. \u201cSo of course the flag waved. Unfurling a piece of rolled-up cloth with sore angular momentum will naturally result in waves and ripples \u2013 no breed required.\u201d So, what happened to the Apollo 11 flag 50 years after it was planted? After the Apollo 11 mission, NASA planted five more flags on the Moon, some of which are still standing today. READ MORE: Footage of NASA lunar buggy \u2018EDITED\u2019 as moon landing FAKE, theory claims\u000a\u000aLunar satellite photos show the Apollo 11 flag has likely fallen over but the Apollo 12, Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 flagpoles are still upright. However, the effects of powerful cosmic radiation washing over the Moon have most likely bleached the flags white. After the Moon landing was successfully completed and the three astronauts returned safely to Earth, the three men recounted their experience. Commander Armstrong said: \u201cIt's a stark and strangely different place, but it looked friendly to me and it proved to be friendly.\u201d Mr Collins said: \u201cI think, long term, we find for the first time that man has the flexibility or the option of either walking this planet or some other planet, be it the Moon or Mars, or I don't know where.\u201d\u000a\u000a1. Astronomers estimate the Moon is slowly drifting away from the Earth at a rate of 1.5 inches (3.8cm) a year. 2. Because of the way the Moon orbits the Earth, we always see the same side facing us. 3. The Moon was most likely created when a Mars-sized object struck the Earth 4.5 billion years ago. 4. When viewed from Earth, the Moon and the Sun are roughly the same size, which is why we observe solar eclipses. 5. There is water on the Moon but it is trapped in the form of ice caps around the satellites poles.

VNASA\u2019S historic 1969 Moon landing has been at the heart of conspiracy theory debate for 50 years now and one major clue conspiracists cite is the flapping US flag planted by Apollo 11\u2019s crew.
