VMOSCOW (AP) \u2014 Stanislav Petrov, a former Soviet military officer known in the West as \u201cthe man who saved the world\u201d for his role in averting a nuclear war over a false missile warning at the height of the Cold War, has died at 77.\u000a\u000aPetrov\u2019s German friend, Karl Schumacher, said Tuesday that he died on May 19. Schumacher called Petrov earlier this month to wish him a happy birthday, but was told by Petrov\u2019s son Dmitry that his father had died. The Russian state Zvezda TV station only reported the death on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aPetrov was on night duty at the Soviet military\u2019s early warning facility outside Moscow on September 26, 1983, when an alarm went off, signaling the launch of several US intercontinental ballistic missiles. The 44-year-old lieutenant colonel had to quickly determine whether the attack was real. He chose to consider it a false alarm, which it was.\u000a\u000aGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\u000a\u000aThe incident was particularly harrowing as it happened at one of the tensest periods of the Cold War when the Soviet Union appeared to genuinely fear a surprise US nuclear attack.\u000a\u000aA few weeks earlier, the Soviets had shot down a passenger plane flying to South Korea from the US, suspecting it of spying, killing all 269 people aboard. The United States, after a series of provocative military maneuvers, was preparing for a major NATO exercise that simulated preparations for a nuclear attack.\u000a\u000aIn a 2015 interview with The Associated Press, Petrov recalled the excruciating moments at the secret Serpukhov-15 control center when the fate of the world was in his hands.\u000a\u000a\u201cI realized that I had to make some kind of decision, and I was only 50/50,\u201d Petrov told AP.\u000a\u000aIf he had judged it a real launch, the top Soviet military brass and the Kremlin would have had no time for extra analysis in a few minutes left before the incoming nuclear-tipped missiles hit Soviet territory. They would have likely ordered a retaliatory strike, triggering a nuclear war.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was this quiet situation and suddenly the roar of the siren breaks in and the command post lights up with the word \u2018LAUNCH,'\u201d Petrov told the AP. \u201cThis hit the nerves. I was really taken aback. Holy cow!\u201d\u000a\u000aWithin minutes of the first alarm, the siren sounded again, warning of a second US missile launch. Soon, the system was reporting that five missiles had been launched.\u000a\u000aPetrov recalled standing up as the alarm siren blared and seeing that the others were all looking at him in confusion.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy team was close to panic and it hit me that if panic sets in then it\u2019s all over,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aPetrov told his commander that the system was giving false information. He was not at all certain, but he was driven by the fact that Soviet ground radar could not confirm a launch. The radar system picked up incoming missiles only well after any launch, but he knew it to be more reliable than the satellites.\u000a\u000aThe false alarm was later determined to have been caused by a malfunction of the satellite, which mistook the reflection of the sun off high clouds for a missile launch.\u000a\u000aPetrov was not rewarded for his actions. In fact, he received a reprimand for failing to correctly fill the duty log and retired from the military the following year.\u000a\u000aAlthough his commanding officer did not support Petrov at the time, he was the one who revealed the incident after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. If Col. Gen. Yury Votintsev had not spoken out, Petrov said he himself \u201cwould have forgotten about it like a bad dream.\u201d\u000a\u000aSince his story was told, Petrov has received accolades, international awards and became known as \u201cthe man who saved the world.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut his role won him little fame in his homeland. He continued to live in a small, unkempt apartment in the Moscow suburb of Fryazino. There have been no official reports or statements about his death from any Russian government agency.\u000a\u000aSchumacher said it was important for him to let the world know about Petrov\u2019s passing because \u201cwe owe this man a lot.\u201d
