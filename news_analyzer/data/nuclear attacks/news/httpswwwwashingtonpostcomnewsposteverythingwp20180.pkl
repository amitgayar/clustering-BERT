VAt 8:07 a.m. Saturday, the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency activated its civilian early warning system with a message sent to cellphones in the state:\u000a\u000a\u201cBALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe one part of the message that was correct was that it was indeed not a drill. It was an accident. No missile was incoming, and the warning was, according to the agency, the result of simple human error. As part of a routine test of readiness, a staffer selected \u201clive alert\u201d rather than \u201ctest alert.\u201d That was all that it took for panic and fear to spread. Hawaiian officials scrambled to tell the public that it was a false alarm, but it still took 38 minutes for the same system to broadcast a message of safety.\u000a\u000aWe live in a tense time. Former secretary of defense William J. Perry recently warned on Twitter that \u201cwe are at greater risk of nuclear catastrophe now than we were during the Cold War,\u201d and although experts and wonks can argue the point, we certainly have all the appearances of being in the grip of a \u201cnuclear war scare\u201d of the sort not yet seen since the Cold War. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) suggested recently that there was a 30 percent chance of Washington using a \u201cmilitary option\u201d against North Korea, and increased that to 70 percent if North Korea tested another nuclear weapon. While some in the Trump administration, leaks suggest, favor a \u201cbloody nose strike\u201d against the regime, Graham at least acknowledges that any attack against North Korea would probably be an existential one to the regime: \u201cThere is no surgical strike option \u2026. So if you ever use the military option, it\u2019s not to just neutralize their nuclear facilities \u2014 you\u2019ve got to be willing to take the regime completely down.\u201d North Korea would surely suspect the same, and react to any attacks as an existential threat, the one scenario in which they could be readily assumed to use their nuclear arsenal against U.S. allies and/or American cities.\u000a\u000a[This is how nuclear war with North Korea would unfold]\u000a\u000aHow much of the war talk is a real reflection of internal administration thinking, how much of it is speculation, and how much is a bluff? Not only is it hard to know from the outside, it may be impossible to know at all at this point. If the past tells us anything, it is that these decisions may not be made, certainly may not be finalized \u2014 may not be part of some grand strategy or plan. They rest on the judgment and determination of very small number of people, on the balance of rivalries and disagreements among Cabinet members, staffers and whoever might have President Trump\u2019s ear at any given moment (even whoever he may be watching). In the case of nuclear weapons use, the authority to order an attack lies with a single person: the president himself.\u000a\u000aWhat does the Hawaii mishap have to do with this? It is, if we needed one, a powerful reminder that we live in a world where information and misinformation spreads like wildfire, where tensions run high and the systems to detect, warn and react are all immensely complex and rely on the participation of fallible human beings.\u000a\u000aThere are, of course, better and worse ways to design these systems. For instance, it was a surprise to learn that the difference between a test alert and an actual alert wasn\u2019t better marked, and maybe more than one confirmation box could have popped up before \u201cTHIS IS NOT A TEST\u201d was broadcast to a million people. Of course, in a world full of confirmation boxes screaming for attention, we have all become somewhat desensitized to them, but user-interface designers have surely come up with systems that are less likely to be triggered accidentally.\u000a\u000aBut if it\u2019s not one thing, it\u2019s another. As the sociologist Charles Perrow wrote decades ago in his aptly titled book \u201cNormal Accidents,\u201d \u201ctrivial events in nontrivial systems\u201d are unavoidable and should be expected. On Saturday, it was the click of a wrong button. In the future, it might be a malfunctioning or hacked computer, a malicious internal operator, an erroneous sensor \u2014 who knows? Perrow\u2019s research found that accidents of an unexpected character, especially those that resulted from some kind of unlikely technical malfunction coupled with human error, happened on an alarmingly regular basis, no matter how much effort was put into quashing the bugs. Usually the damage done was local and reversible. But in some systems, such as those involved with nuclear weapons, the consequences could be massive.\u000a\u000aThe Cold War was full of such computer and sensor malfunctions, both in the United States and the Soviet Union, which set off warnings that missiles were inbound. Those that came during times of reduced tensions were easily understood as probable errors. Those that came during the times of fear and mistrust \u2014 such as the Cuban missile crisis or the War Scare of 1983 \u2014 pushed the world perilously close to the nuclear brink.\u000a\u000a[A bomb is just minutes from destroying your world. Now what?]\u000a\u000aSome of the stories are so absurd as to be scarcely believable, if the documentation did not back them up. Scott Sagan, in his book \u201cThe Limits of Safety,\u201d relates several, but here was the strangest: At a military base in Minnesota during the height of the Cuban missile crisis, a guard mistook a bear for a Soviet saboteur. He sounded the intruder alarm, which rang warning bells at other bases in the region. At Volk Airfield, however, the warning bell was erroneously wired, and instead a nuclear attack warning went off, causing nuclear-armed jets to scramble, searching for enemies. You can\u2019t make this stuff up.\u000a\u000aOne of the lessons that President John F. Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev took away from the crisis as a whole is that once tensions are high, even the supposed leaders are no longer in complete control. All it would take is one stray fighter, one malfunctioning system, one bad decision at a low level, one incorrectly communicated message, and hundreds of millions would die. As it was, there were many false alarms during the Cuban missile crisis alone \u2014 including one in which an American warning system erroneously detected an incoming missile from Cuba! It was not the robustness of our system, or even the judgment of our politicians and military, that saved us then or during the rest of the Cold War. It was, as then-Defense Secretary Robert McNamara would later emphasize: \u201cIn the end, we lucked out. It was luck that prevented nuclear war.\u201d\u000a\u000aWe don\u2019t have to accept this as our fate, as yet another terrible aspect of the world we happen to live in. There are ways to make the chance of war, by poor decision or malfunction, less likely. At one extreme, of course, we could find a way to dismantle the global nuclear weapons system. This does not seem likely in the next year or so, especially given that the soon-to-be-released Nuclear Posture Review of the United States seems to put (if a leaked draft is an indication) even more emphasis on the importance of nuclear weapons. And it seems unlikely that North Korea will be scared into giving up its nuclear arsenal in the near term. No state that has ever given up nuclear arms it possessed did so out of fear; fear is what drives states to get, and to improve upon, their weapons, not to give them up.\u000a\u000aSimilarly, one could hope that the Hawaii incident will be a wake-up call for state and federal agencies who are meant to communicate with the public on these matters to review their systems with closer scrutiny to the possibility of human error, system malfunction or deliberate manipulation by hackers.\u000a\u000aBut ultimately the short-term solution would be to decrease international tensions, to get us out of this war scare. Our leaders and diplomats have the power to defuse this crisis, if they choose to use it. They probably can\u2019t force North Korea to denuclearize. But they can send a strong, unambiguous signal: The United States does not seek war if it can at all be avoided, and the United States would not attack North Korea unless it crossed a well-defined and credible red line (such as attacking our bases or allies). If North Korea didn\u2019t think we were itching to destroy it, it might be less likely to do something fatal.\u000a\u000aBecause if our systems can fail, so can theirs. And consider this: What\u2019s scarier than a false warning of a North Korean nuclear missile? A North Korean early warning system, all too fallible itself, ever searching for that incoming attack.\u000a\u000aPresidents have too much power over U.S. nukes. Especially President Trump.\u000a\u000aNo one can stop Trump from using nuclear weapons. That\u2019s by design.\u000a\u000aIf Trump wants to use nuclear weapons, whether it\u2019s \u2018legal\u2019 won\u2019t matter
