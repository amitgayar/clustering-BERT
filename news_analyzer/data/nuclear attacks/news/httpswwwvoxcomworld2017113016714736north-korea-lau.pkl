VNorth Korea\u2019s latest test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) Tuesday showed that the country now has the capability to strike the entire United States \u2014 and there\u2019s little America can do to stop it.\u000a\u000aThe test revealed just how dramatically North Korea\u2019s missile program has advanced over the past year, and how much more of a threat the country now poses to the US. In April, Pyongyang tested a missile that blew up just seconds after launch. Tuesday\u2019s missile, however, flew more than 10 times higher than the International Space Station, and was in the air for 54 minutes before landing near Japan.\u000a\u000aThe North Korean missile advances are happening despite pressure from the international community, which continues to slap economic sanctions on the country. President Donald Trump is expected to impose new financial restrictions on Pyongyang Wednesday, just one week after the US increased penalties when it put North Korea back on the state sponsors of terrorism list.\u000a\u000aOn top of that, North Korea tested its most powerful nuclear bomb ever on September 3, and it may have stockpiled up to 60 nuclear weapons. Making matters worse, the US military believes North Korea already has the capability to \u201cminiaturize\u201d a nuclear weapon and fit it onto that missile, which it could then use to hit major US cities like Washington, DC.\u000a\u000aTaken together, it looks like there\u2019s little Trump can do to stop North Korea\u2019s march toward a missile that can carry a nuclear weapon to the American mainland. And even more alarming, it\u2019s not clear that he or the US military could stop a missile if North Korea were to fire one at the US.\u000a\u000aThe test demonstrated that North Korea now has ballistic missiles that can hit all of the mainland US. What North Korea hasn\u2019t been able to show conclusively yet is that it has the ability to hit all of the mainland US with a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile.\u000a\u000aThere is reason to think North Korea still has some work to do before it gets there. After all, launching nuclear missiles that can strike targets thousands of miles away is hard. I mean, it is literally rocket science.\u000a\u000aTo hit a target with a nuclear-tipped ICBM, the nuclear-tipped part has to be able to survive the journey up into space and back down through Earth\u2019s atmosphere without disintegrating or detonating, and make it all the way to its target on the other side of the globe. That\u2019s pretty hard to do, and the North Koreans haven\u2019t yet demonstrated that they\u2019ve figured out how to do that part.\u000a\u000aSome experts believe they can. \u201cWhat more evidence do we want: 200 kilotons going off in Palm Beach?\u201d Jeffrey Lewis, an expert on North Korea\u2019s missile program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told me in an interview.\u000a\u000aOther experts were more cautious, telling me that North Korea has yet to show it can reliably strike America with a nuclear weapon \u2014 but the US should start assuming that it can.\u000a\u000aBut that\u2019s really the last stumbling block still facing Kim and his team of rocket scientists. \u201cOnce they prove that, then Pyongyang has crossed the atomic finish line,\u201d said Harry Kazianis, an Asia security expert at the Center for the National Interest.\u000a\u000aBut let\u2019s assume for the sake of argument that North Korea can reliably fire a nuclear missile that could make it all the way to the US. Would we be able to shoot it down?\u000a\u000aThe answer, it turns out, is \u201cprobably not.\u201d The US does have a missile defense system in place to protect itself. But it\u2019s imperfect at best.\u000a\u000aIt basically works like this: if a country shoots a missile in our direction, America launches its own interceptors \u2014 that is, missiles \u2014 to destroy the hostile weapon in the sky. This is why some people refer to missile defense as \u201chitting a bullet with another bullet.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe US has a total of 44 interceptors stationed in Alaska and California that could be used if North Korea shot at America, experts tell me. In May, the US had its biggest success yet when it tested the missile defense system under realistic conditions: Rockets launched from California destroyed the incoming mock ICBM in midair.\u000a\u000aThe problem, though, is that these tests are carried out under highly controlled conditions. As Lewis told me after the test in May, the \u201ctarget was fired right at the interceptor on a nice sunny day with lots of warning.\u201d In an actual warlike scenario, the US doesn\u2019t get to dictate the conditions.\u000a\u000aIf an actual attack happens, there will likely be some warning, but probably not much. The US may not be fully confident where the missile is headed, what kind of ICBM it is (yes, there are multiple kinds), or other factors.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s even more bad news: The missile defense system has only passed 10 of 18 tests, Kingston Reif, the director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association, told me. And, again, all of those happened under controlled circumstances.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s worth highlighting: Even in the best conditions, the system in place to protect America from a North Korean nuclear weapon has just over a 50 percent success rate. That\u2019s why experts are generally pessimistic about US capabilities to stop a North Korean weapon headed our way.\u000a\u000a\u201cDepending on the trajectory, we should not assume that we can, with any reliability, intercept ICBM warhead targets,\u201d says Vipin Narang, a nuclear expert at MIT.\u000a\u000aAnd this is all assuming that North Korea only shoots one nuclear-tipped missile at the US. If it were to launch multiple projectiles, that could overwhelm America\u2019s defenses. Official US policy is to shoot four interceptors per incoming ICBM, Narang told me. Since the US only has 44 ready to go, the system would be saturated if Pyongyang were to launch 11 missiles our way.\u000a\u000aEvery previous US president who\u2019s dealt with North Korea since its nuclear program began \u2014 Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama \u2014 failed to stop Pyongyang\u2019s missile and nuclear programs. And Trump came into office with essentially the same three broad \u2014 and bad \u2014 options that they had: 1) military strikes, 2) diplomacy, or 3) economic sanctions.\u000a\u000aOption 1 is incredibly dangerous, and options 2 and 3 have a mixed track record at best.\u000a\u000aFirst, there\u2019s the military option, which experts believe would do far more harm than good. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s programs are too sophisticated and dispersed to think that we could destroy them with military strikes, never mind the devastating regional retaliation that would ensue,\u201d Mira Rapp-Hooper, an Asia security expert at Yale Law School, said in an interview. \u201cYou cannot bomb away scientific knowledge, and North Korea\u2019s quick indigenous developments indicate that this knowledge runs deep.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut if the US believed North Korea was about to attack first, Trump could launch a preemptive surgical strike on North Korea \u2014 narrowly targeting the country\u2019s missile and nuclear sites without causing too much damage beyond those few sites.\u000a\u000aThat would certainly address the immediate threat to the US, but North Korea would almost certainly retaliate \u2014 potentially imperiling the safety of not just Americans but millions of people in South Korea and Japan. Indeed, most experts believe that those two countries would be the first targets of Kim\u2019s wrath should the US attack.\u000a\u000aPyongyang has the world\u2019s largest artillery arsenal at its disposal, with around 8,000 rocket launchers and artillery cannons on its side of the Demilitarized Zone between the North and South, and it could use that arsenal to strike the South Korean capital, Seoul. It could also use its short-range missiles to strike Tokyo and other large Japanese urban areas, some of them with only about a 10-minute warning. The US has about 23,500 troops in South Korea and around 50,000 troops in Japan, which would also be in danger.\u000a\u000aSimulations of a large-scale artillery fight produce pretty bleak results. One war game convened by the Atlantic back in 2005 predicted that a North Korean attack would kill 100,000 people in Seoul in the first few days alone. Others put the estimate even higher. A war game mentioned by the National Interest predicted Seoul could \u201cbe hit by over half-a-million shells in under an hour.\u201d Those results don\u2019t bode well for one of Washington\u2019s closest allies, or for the 25.6 million people living in Seoul.\u000a\u000aNone of this even factors in the large-scale refugee crisis that a war would create, where millions would flock north to China as their homes and livelihoods are ravaged by war. That\u2019s something China expressly does not want.\u000a\u000aSo far the Trump administration has avoided striking North Korea, preferring to pursue a strategy Trump officials call \u201cmaximum pressure and engagement.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile diplomacy is our preferred means of changing North Korea\u2019s course of action, it is backed by military options,\u201d Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson wrote in an August 13 op-ed. \u201cThe US is willing to negotiate with Pyongyang. But given the long record of North Korea\u2019s dishonesty in negotiations and repeated violations of international agreements, it is incumbent upon the regime to signal its desire to negotiate in good faith.\u201d\u000a\u000aClearly, that approach hasn\u2019t worked so far. But to be fair, diplomacy hasn\u2019t worked for past administrations either.\u000a\u000aAmerica has tried to come to some sort of diplomatic, negotiated agreement with North Korea over its programs since 1985, according to the Arms Control Association. But on each occasion, talks between the US, North Korea, and other world powers collapsed because North Korea walked away. However, experts tell me it was unlikely Kim would have given up his country\u2019s missile and nuclear programs.\u000a\u000aThe Kim family, which has been in power since Kim Il Sung took charge in 1948, has seen what happens to leaders who don\u2019t have nuclear weapons. In modern times, Iraq\u2019s Saddam Hussein persuaded much of the world that he had restarted his country\u2019s nuclear weapons program; he hadn\u2019t, but the boasts helped spark the 2003 invasion that drove him from power. In Libya, Muammar Qaddafi gave up his program to build closer ties to the West, but was eventually ousted from power and killed by a mob.\u000a\u000aSo Kim Jong Un, Kim Il Sung\u2019s grandson, has no incentive to stop any of its programs. In fact, he has incentives to keep them going.\u000a\u000aAnd then there are sanctions, which are meant to financially cripple Pyongyang to the point that it would enter into negotiations with America and others to curb its nuclear program. The problem is sanctions tend to work much better before a country obtains what it wants, Sheena Greitens, a North Korea expert at the University of Missouri, told me in September.\u000a\u000aIn this case, North Korea achieved a big step toward its goal of having a missile that can carry a nuclear weapon to America\u2019s largest cities. It\u2019s going to be hard at this point to use sanctions to change the North\u2019s behavior when Pyongyang feels like it is so close to the finish line.\u000a\u000aSo what\u2019s left? As my colleague Zack Beauchamp has written, some experts think that, at this point, we should just accept that North Korea has nuclear weapons. Instead of trying to get the country to give them up, we should work to contain the damage a nuclear North Korea could wreak.\u000a\u000aBut it doesn\u2019t look like the president will take that advice. He promised in January that he wouldn\u2019t allow North Korea to develop a missile that could bring a nuclear weapon to America.\u000a\u000aIt turns out that North Korea likely has that ability now, and if not, it will soon. That means Trump \u2014 and all of us \u2014 are stuck with the danger North Korea poses for the foreseeable future.
