VWHAT\u2019S AN ILLEGAL ORDER? The nation\u2019s top U.S. nuclear commander weighed in this weekend on what would happen if President Trump were to order an \u201cillegal\u201d nuclear attack on another country. Speaking on a panel over the weekend at the Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia, Air Force Gen. John Hyten said he would push back if the order was not in compliance with the law of armed conflict. \u201cIf you execute an unlawful order, you will go to jail. You could go to jail for the rest of your life,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a"I think some people think we're stupid. We're not stupid people. We think about these things a lot. When you have this responsibility, how do you not think about it?" Hyten said, when asked about last week\u2019s congressional testimony by a former U.S. nuclear commander that military officers have a responsibility not to carry out an illegal order from their civilian superiors. \u201cThe way the process works is it\u2019s simple,\u201d Hyten explained. "I provide advice to the president, he will tell me what to do, and if it's illegal, guess what's going to happen? I'm going to say, 'Mr. President, that's illegal.' And guess what he's going to do? He's going to say, 'What would be legal?' And we'll come up with options of a mix of capabilities to respond to whatever the situation is, and that's the way it works. It's not that complicated."\u000a\u000aACTUALLY IT\u2019S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED: The real question in that scenario is what constitutes an illegal order? At the Halifax Forum, Hyten ticked off the factors that need to be considered: necessity, distinction, proportionality, unnecessary suffering, and said they applied equally to small arms and nuclear weapons. Hyten says over his 36 years in uniform the law of armed conflict has been drilled into him, with the most famous example of an unlawful order being the destruction of the village of My Lai during the Vietnam War, in which more than 500 people were slaughtered.\u000a\u000aBut at last week\u2019s Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Sen. Marco Rubio warned against military attorney\u2019s second-guessing the commander in chief in a crisis. \u201cI think we all understand \u2026 you can't have military officials ordered to go on to a village full of civilians and kill everybody. That clearly violates the law that governs armed conflict,\u201d Rubio said. But on the other hand, \u201cWe cannot have a bunch of bunker lawyers ... or activists up and down the chain who decide that they're going to disobey any order that they disagree with.\u201d\u000a\u000aDEPENDS ON WHO\u2019S WAKING UP WHOM: There\u2019s another way to think of it, offered Duke University professor Peter Feaver at last week\u2019s hearing. \u201cWhat I would say is distinguish between scenarios where the military wake up the president versus scenarios where the president's waking up the military. Where the military wakes up the president and warns him that there is about to be an attack, where they were experiencing attack, in those settings, the president has a very limited time window to make a decision. He would make a decision, he alone would have the authority to make the decision and I think we all believe that the system would carry out the order that he gave. The electorate on election day chose him to make that decision.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut in the other context where the president's waking up the military, maybe in an extreme funk saying, \u2018I'm angry and I want something done.\u2019 In that setting, he requires the cooperation of a lot of people who would be asking exactly the questions that [ Gen. Robert Kehler] outlined. What's the context, why is this? And the president alone could not affect the strike. He would require lots of people cooperating with him to make the strike happen. And they'd be asking the questions that would slow down that process. And so the context matters greatly for this.\u201d\u000a\u000aPATRIOTS TO POLAND: The State Department has approved a possible sale of advanced Patriot missile batteries to Poland. Price tag: $10.5 billion. The decision authorizes the sale to Poland, a NATO ally, and is expected to be completed before the year\u2019s end. Poland is expected to buy Raytheon PAC-3 missiles, along with 16 launchers, and long with associated radars and spare parts, in order to bolster its missile defense against Russia.\u000a\u000aTrump touted the Patriot system this month when it successfully shot down a missile fired into Saudi Arabia from Yemen. And on its website, Raytheon claims Patriots intercepted more than 100 tactical ballistic missiles in combat since 2015, the year the Saudi-led war against Iranian-backed Houthis began.\u000a\u000aWITHER THE INF TREATY? Poland\u2019s desire for more robust missile defenses comes as NATO has accused Russia of violating a Cold war-era treaty banning short and intermediate range missiles with a secret deployment of a new land-based cruise missile. So far, U.S. efforts to convince Russian President Vladimir Putin to admit to the flagrant violation and return to compliance with the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty have failed. Deep in the Defense authorization bill just passed by Congress are the seeds of what could be the eventual demise of the treaty: $58 million for the U.S. to design a similar Ground Launched Cruise Missile or GLCM. Designing the missile would not violate the INF, but producing it would. Critics, such as U.S. Pacific Commander Adm. Harry Harris, have another big problem with the 30-year-old arms treaty. It doesn\u2019t apply to China, which is free to develop all sorts of land-based missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles.

Tariq Shah Bahrami to the Pentagon at 1:30 p.m.\u000a\u000aTOO SILENT, TOO DEEP: The U.S. Navy and NASA are assisting in an international effort to track down an Argentine navy submarine with 44 crew members that has been missing for several days.\u000a\u000aThe lost vessel, the ARA San Juan, has been out of radio contact since Wednesday somewhere around the southern tip of South America in the Atlantic Ocean. However, late Saturday, the Argentine Defense Ministry said it detected several failed \u201csatellite calls,\u201d likely from the missing submarine, providing some hope that it would soon be found.\u000a\u000aThe Navy said Saturday that Undersea Rescue Command was deploying its San Diego-based rescue assets to the area, due to arrive on Sunday. This follows the arrival of two aircraft that were sent Saturday to assist with in the search \u2014 a Navy P-8A Poseidon multi-mission maritime aircraft and a NASA P-3 research aircraft.\u000a\u000aTHINGS THAT GO BUMP IN THE SEA: A U.S. destroyer sustained minor damage after a collision with a tugboat near Japan, according to 7th Fleet. The USS Benfold, which is a guided-missile destroyer, had been participating in a scheduled towing exercise in Sagami Wan, a bay south of Tokyo, on Saturday when a Japanese tug boat lost propulsion and drifted into the U.S. ship, 7th Fleet said in a statement.\u000a\u000aNo injuries were reported and minor damage was done to Benfold, including scrapes on its side. While the tug boat is being towed to a port in Yokosuka, Benfold remains at sea on its own power.\u000a\u000aLOOK, UP IN THE SKY, IT\u2019S A...: The Navy has grounded an aircrew over \u201cwholly unacceptable\u201d behavior after aviators drew a what appeared to even the most casual observer to be penis in the sky with jet exhaust over Washington state on Thursday.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe American people rightfully expect that those who wear the Wings of Gold exhibit a level of maturity commensurate with the missions and aircraft with which they've been entrusted,\u201d said Vice Adm. Mike Shoemaker, command of Naval Air Forces. \u201cNaval aviation continually strives to foster an environment of dignity and respect. Sophomoric and immature antics of a sexual nature have no place in naval aviation today. We will investigate this incident to get all the facts and act accordingly.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis event clearly stands in stark contrast to the way our aviators and sailors are performing with utmost professionalism, discipline and excellence from our carrier flight decks and expeditionary airfields around the world today."\u000a\u000aAP: Syria: IS Militants Defeated In Last Major Stronghold\u000a\u000aNew York Times: After Huge Truck Bombings, U.S. Steps Up Attacks Against Somali Militants\u000a\u000aPolitico: U.S. Military Builds Up In Land Of \u2018Black Hawk Down\u2019 Disaster\u000a\u000aMilitary Times : US troops lack support despite expanding mission in Africa\u000a\u000aAir Force Times: The Air Force is throwing money at pilots to stay.
