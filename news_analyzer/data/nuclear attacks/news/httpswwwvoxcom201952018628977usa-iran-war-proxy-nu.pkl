VFor the past two weeks, the US and much of the world has been consumed by a terrifying question: Is America going to war with Iran?\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s an understandable question. The Trump administration says it has intelligence showing that Iran plans to attack Americans in the Middle East. Iran, meanwhile, has told its proxies to prepare for war and indicated it may soon restart some activities related to its nuclear program (though it hasn\u2019t said that it plans to pursue a nuclear weapon).\u000a\u000aThose developments, combined with the rise of Iran hawks in the administration like National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have led to widespread fear that some sort of conflict between Washington and Tehran is imminent.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s the good news: Right now it seems fairly unlikely that a full-blown war is on the horizon, mostly because President Donald Trump and American allies don\u2019t want one. Nor does Iran, it seems.\u000a\u000aBut the situation is still very tense, and the room for error and miscalculation on both sides remains high.\u000a\u000aSo what exactly is going on? How did we get here? Why did this escalation happen so suddenly? And what would a conflict with Iran even look like, anyway? The confusion is fair. After all, Trump seems to enjoy keeping everyone \u2014 including the Iranians \u2014 guessing.\u000a\u000aBut don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got you covered. What follows are answers to some of the most pressing questions about the latest US-Iran standoff; hopefully they\u2019ll allow you to breathe just a little easier.\u000a\u000aThe current crisis started on May 5, when National Security Adviser John Bolton announced the US was deploying an aircraft carrier and bomber planes to the Persian Gulf in response to \u201ca number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings\u201d of threats from Iran.\u000a\u000aThis move, Bolton said, was meant \u201cto send a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force.\u201d He said that the US \u201cis not seeking war with the Iranian regime,\u201d but added, \u201cwe are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt the time, it was unclear exactly what that intelligence said, but in the days since, reports have provided a bit more clarity. Iran apparently intended to target US troops in Iraq and Syria, or even use drones against Americans in a key waterway near Yemen. There was also information that Iran put cruise missiles on ships, heightening fears that it might attack US Navy vessels with them.\u000a\u000aThe severity of the intelligence remains in dispute, and some say Bolton and others have inflated the threat. What isn\u2019t in dispute is that America\u2019s response dramatically raised the tension between the two countries \u2014 and a series of events in the following days only made things worse.\u000a\u000aOn May 8, three days after Bolton\u2019s statement, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced that his country would no longer comply with parts of the 2015 nuclear deal if European signatories to the deal didn\u2019t provide Iran with financial relief within 60 days.\u000a\u000aSpecifically, Rouhani said Iran would start stockpiling extra low-enriched uranium and heavy water, the kind used in nuclear reactors that could be used to produce a nuclear weapon, and would enrich uranium to previously banned levels.\u000a\u000aAll those actions remain banned by the agreement, which Iran, as well as some European powers, Russia, and China, is still party to. But Tehran\u2019s decision, which it telegraphed days in advance, came exactly one year after Trump ended the US\u2019s commitment to the accord.\u000a\u000aRouhani made sure all of that wasn\u2019t an escalation. \u201cThe path we have chosen today is not the path of war,\u201d he said, \u201cit is the path of diplomacy.\u201d\u000a\u000aStill, that set the stage for a potential confrontation: The Trump administration doesn\u2019t want Iran to get a nuclear weapon, and while Rouhani\u2019s announcement still wouldn\u2019t put Tehran anywhere near obtaining the bomb, it inched a little closer. And with the threat of a military fight hanging over it all, the chance for miscalculation grew.\u000a\u000aBut it didn\u2019t stop there. A few days later, four oil tankers were damaged in attacks near the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway aggressively patrolled by Iran through which a third of the world\u2019s liquefied natural gas and almost 20 percent of the world\u2019s oil production flows.\u000a\u000aTwo of the oil tankers belonged to Saudi Arabia and one belonged to the United Arab Emirates \u2014 both staunch enemies of Iran and friends to the US. (The fourth was owned by a Norwegian company.)\u000a\u000aUnnamed US officials told NBC News that it\u2019s \u201chighly likely\u201d based on intelligence that Iran or groups allied with it were behind the attacks, a similar conclusion reached by a Norwegian insurance company that assesses risk to shipping vessels, according to a confidential report seen by Reuters. However, details of the attacks remain murky, and neither the US nor anyone else has publicly provided any concrete evidence to back up the accusation against Iran.\u000a\u000aIran itself denied any involvement \u2014 but one day later, Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen launched an attack on a Saudi oil pipeline. And one of Iran\u2019s top military leaders reportedly told militias in Iraq to prepare for a war. That may explain why the US chose to remove some staff from the embassy in Baghdad and its consulate in Erbil last week.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration has also sent anti-missile batteries to the Middle East, adding even more firepower to its growing military stance there.\u000a\u000aPut together, it\u2019s a fraught, delicate, and dangerous situation that could spiral out of control if not carefully managed by both countries. Worries of war are widespread, and it\u2019s not clear how the US and Iran will walk back from the brink.\u000a\u000aThe US and Iran have been at odds for decades. Since a 1979 revolution in Iran that overthrew the American-backed and installed leader, both countries have held aggressive stances toward the other. Over the years, Iranian-backed groups have fought and attacked US forces, leaving hundreds of American troops dead in total. The US has also launched assaults of its own, including a devastating cyberattack, a naval strike, and mistakenly downing an Iranian commercial airliner.\u000a\u000aIn other words, US-Iran relations have always teetered on a knife\u2019s edge, and it takes just a little push to make an ever-present dilemma much worse. In this case, three recent \u201cpushes\u201d in particular sparked the current standoff.\u000a\u000aFirst, the US withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal last year, reimposing sanctions on the country and compelling European allies to stop importing Iranian oil. That has started to tank Iran\u2019s economy.\u000a\u000aSecond is how the intelligence and military actions have been perceived over the past two weeks.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, one interpretation of the US-obtained information is that Iran feared an imminent American attack. As a result, Iran is taking provocative measures in preparation.\u000a\u000aThat view would make sense, according to some Iran experts. \u201cTo counterattack in response to pressure is a standard part of the Iranian playbook,\u201d Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, tweeted on May 6.\u000a\u000aMisperception and miscalculation are always worrisome in situations like this. One wrong move by the US, for example, could lead Iran to think war is afoot, thereby compelling Tehran to make aggressive countermoves or even launch assaults of its own. The same is true if Tehran startles Washington with some action, leading the White House to authorize a strike.\u000a\u000aWhich takes us to the third \u201cpush\u201d: the Iran hawks in the Trump administration who are itching for a fight.\u000a\u000aJohn Bolton, Trump\u2019s top national security aide, has long argued for regime change in Iran and advocated for bombing the country to stop it from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has also pushed the US to confront the Iranian regime.\u000a\u000aLast May, he gave a speech outlining 12 ways the clerical government must change \u2014 including stopping its support for proxy groups and halting its missile program \u2014 before the US lifts any financial and diplomatic pressure off Tehran.\u000a\u000aTogether, they have made the Trump administration a lot more antagonistic toward the Islamic Republic. It\u2019s a stark difference from when Trump was flanked by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. While they both expressed deep distrust of Iran, they didn\u2019t make maximalist demands or threaten conflict so brazenly.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s important to note that Trump says he doesn\u2019t want a war with Iran, but the problem is that he\u2019s effectively outsourced his Iran policy to the hawks. That means that at a time when cooler heads should prevail, there aren\u2019t many cool heads to be found.\u000a\u000a\u201cMoments like these are when institutions should matter: leadership at the cabinet level, a serious policy-making process, intelligence standards, professional ethics. All those have been eroded by the Trump administration,\u201d Maloney tweeted.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s hard to find two more anti-Iran figures in Washington than the national security adviser and the secretary of state.\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s start with Bolton: The longtime Republican official and operative rarely has found an authoritarian regime he hasn\u2019t wanted to punish in some way, but Iran seems to hold a special place in his heart.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, he wrote an op-ed for the New York Times making the case that the US should bomb Iran to keep it from getting a nuclear weapon. \u201cIran will not negotiate away its nuclear program,\u201d Bolton wrote, slamming the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to strike a diplomatic agreement with Tehran. \u201cThe inconvenient truth is that only military action ... can accomplish what is required. Time is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd in 2017, just eight months before becoming Trump\u2019s third national security adviser, Bolton gave a paid speech to an Iranian exile group that wants to overthrow the country\u2019s leadership.\u000a\u000aClearly, he agrees with them: \u201cThe declared policy of the United States should be the overthrow of the mullahs\u2019 regime in Tehran,\u201d he said. \u201cThe behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change and, therefore, the only solution is to change the regime itself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBefore 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran,\u201d he concluded. Well, it\u2019s 2019 now, so perhaps Bolton hopes to make up for lost time.\u000a\u000aWhere Bolton\u2019s animus seems driven by Cold War-era thinking, Pompeo\u2019s seems to come from something much deeper.\u000a\u000aThe nation\u2019s chief diplomat has made no secret of his evangelical Christian faith, which he admits guides his policy views. That holds true for world affairs, where his religious beliefs have partly led him to offer unqualified support for Israel, a key American ally \u2014 and for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who sees Iran as an existential threat to his country.\u000a\u000aDuring a March 20 visit to Jerusalem, for example, Pompeo and Netanyahu both vowed to continue their joint pressure on Iran. Five days later, the secretary gave a speech to the pro-Israel lobby group American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) to show his support for the US ally and disdain for Iran.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve enacted the strongest pressure campaign in history against Iran and its proxies, and they are feeling the pain,\u201d Pompeo said to applause. He added: \u201cAnti-Zionism is anti-Semitism, and any nation that espouses anti-Zionism, like Iran, must be confronted. We must defend the rightful homeland of the Jewish people.\u201d\u000a\u000aPompeo, then, has expressly linked America\u2019s combative stance against Iran to support for Israel. While he has also said Iran deserves pushback for its pursuit of a nuclear program and its support for terrorists and dictators like Bashar al-Assad in Syria, it\u2019s clear Pompeo views Iran as a threat to a country important to his Christian faith.\u000a\u000aWhich means Bolton and Pompeo are unlikely to tamp down growing tensions with Iran. If anything, they will want to escalate matters now that they have the chance.\u000a\u000aBreathe easy: It doesn\u2019t look like the US will go to war with Iran anytime soon, although that possibility can\u2019t be fully counted out. But there are three main reasons for optimism (or just not outright pessimism).\u000a\u000aFirst, the US military deployments to the Middle East aren\u2019t so out of the ordinary, some experts say.\u000a\u000aSure, the US moved an anti-missile battery to the region recently, but it removed four of them a few months ago, Ilan Goldenberg, an Iran expert at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, tweeted on May 11. He added that the aircraft carrier sent to the Middle East to deter an Iranian attack was previously scheduled to be in the region.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo what is actually happening? Someone in the administration has decided to dramatically increase the media posture of the US government around these deployments to apply pressure on Iran,\u201d Goldenberg continued. The reason for the exaggeration, though, is not entirely clear.\u000a\u000aSecond, Trump doesn\u2019t want a war with Iran. He campaigned on not getting the US further involved in wars abroad, particularly in the Middle East. While Trump is no dove on Iran and seems to relish the US-led pressure on it, he\u2019s not aching for a fight like some around him. He reportedly told his Pentagon chief on Wednesday that he doesn\u2019t want to get into a skirmish with Iran right now.\u000a\u000aAnd when Trump was asked on Thursday if the US was going to war Iran, he simply responded: \u201cHope not.\u201d\u000a\u000aThird, it actually seems like tensions may be lowering substantially. For example, Pompeo is leaning on European allies to compel Iran to \u201cde-escalate\u201d the tensions, the New York Times reported on Thursday. It\u2019s unclear if he\u2019s doing this under Trump\u2019s orders or if he\u2019s decided to tamp down his typical hawkish Iran policies for the time being. And according to the Wall Street Journal, two US destroyers sailed through the Strait of Hormuz without a hitch last Thursday. \u201cIt was the quietest transit we have seen in a long time,\u201d a defense official told the Journal.\u000a\u000aSo the US-Iran standoff isn\u2019t quite as dire as it seems and may settle down in the coming days. That\u2019s not guaranteed, of course, as there\u2019s always room for error. But for now, it doesn\u2019t look like the US and Iran are going to war.\u000a\u000aBased on the Trump administration\u2019s statements and past US policy, America might choose to go to war for three reasons: 1) Iran gets close to obtaining a nuclear weapon, 2) the US decides to overthrow the regime, or 3) Iran launches a massive attack on Americans requiring an even bigger response in return.\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s start with the nuclear issue. US policy in this and previous administrations is that Iran should not have a nuclear weapon. That\u2019s why President Barack Obama signed the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 to delay Tehran\u2019s path to the bomb. Trump pulled out of the deal for a variety of reasons, but one was that he claimed it made Iran\u2019s ability to get a nuke more likely, even though most experts disagree.\u000a\u000aAs of today, Iran is still far away from having a reliable nuclear arsenal at its disposal \u2014 and it has never officially said it is even seeking the bomb in the first place. But if it starts to move seriously in that direction, one could imagine folks like Bolton and Netanyahu pushing for a military strike on its nuclear facilities. As a sign of Israel\u2019s seriousness on this issue, it has reportedly even killed nuclear scientists working for the Iranian regime.\u000a\u000aBut what would that actually accomplish in the long run? Would we be able to stop Iran from ever getting a bomb if it really wanted to?\u000a\u000a\u201cWe can probably destroy the existing program\u201d with limited strikes, Richard Nephew, an architect of the Iran nuclear deal, told me. But \u201cwe cannot prevent Iran from reconstituting that program. So we would then have to either attack again in the future to deal with a reconstituted nuclear program or acquiesce to Iran having a nuclear weapon.\u201d\u000a\u000aAttacking Iran, he added, could actually compel the country to pursue the bomb in earnest in order to deter more US strikes.\u000a\u000aOkay, so what about starting a war to overthrow the regime? That\u2019s even less likely to happen, as it would take a colossal military effort. Reports show that one administration plan includes sending 120,000 US troops to the Middle East, a plan Trump denies is in the works.\u000a\u000aColin Kahl, who oversaw the Pentagon\u2019s Iran planning from 2009 to 2011, tweeted on May 13 that the US would only deploy that many service members if regime change was the goal, although he noted it\u2019s still too small of a force for a full-scale invasion.\u000a\u000aBy comparison, the US sent around 150,000 troops in the initial phase of the 2003 invasion of Iraq \u2014 and Iran is a much bigger country than Iraq.\u000a\u000aIf the White House aims to remove Iran\u2019s leadership permanently, then, it would need to launch an invasion on a scale even bigger than the one in Iraq \u2014 starting what would be one of the most horrific wars in recent memory and leading to hundreds of thousands dead.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s hard to imagine Trump would find much love for a full-scale war. \u201cAlmost nobody would support an Iraq-like ground invasion for regime change under current circumstances,\u201d Eric Brewer, who worked on Iran in Trump\u2019s National Security Council, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to over-emphasize how costly such a conflict would be.\u201d\u000a\u000aFinally, war could break out if Iran were to attack American forces. Iran\u2019s military leadership does have its troops and proxies on high alert, but that doesn\u2019t mean Tehran plans to imminently attack Americans.\u000a\u000aThe Islamic Republic is almost certainly aware that any action that puts US troops, diplomats, or private citizens in mortal danger will provide Trump advisers like Bolton or Pompeo with the ammunition needed to push harder for war.\u000a\u000aThe pressure will also be on Trump to respond in kind \u2014 if not more forcefully \u2014 if Iran kills Americans during this tense time. That therefore incentivizes Tehran not to make overly provocative moves right now.\u000a\u000aLuckily, then, none of these main pathways to war seem particularly open. And while it\u2019s unlikely they will be, that\u2019s not a certainty either.\u000a\u000aThat really comes down to what the US wants to accomplish, experts say. As noted above, war could take the form of targeted US military strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, or it could look like a full-scale invasion of Iran by the US.\u000a\u000aBut it\u2019s worth noting that there are lower-level ways the US and Iran could fight each other.\u000a\u000aFor example, the US could launch cyberattacks on Iran\u2019s infrastructure and power grid, a plan the military has already named \u201cNitro Zeus.\u201d The Obama administration used this method to bring down part of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. However, Iran has cyber capabilities of its own that it could use to target important American companies or even the government.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s more, Iran\u2019s proxies across the Middle East could target Americans in Iraq, Syria, or elsewhere in the Middle East. Perhaps worried about that possibility, the US removed staff from two of its missions in Iraq last week.\u000a\u000aImportantly, Iran doesn\u2019t have nuclear weapons, so the worst attack imaginable is off the table. Still, it\u2019s possible that Tehran could use its growing missile program to target American ships and troops in the area.\u000a\u000aIt therefore wouldn\u2019t take a full-on fight for things to get really, really bad between the US and Iran pretty quickly. Let\u2019s hope we don\u2019t find out.\u000a\u000aMainly no, but there are some out there who do.\u000a\u000aIsrael, which in the past has advocated for strikes on Iran, is actively trying to stay out of the fray. The main reason is that a major war with Tehran would certainly involve Israel, most likely pitting it against Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s ally and proxy in Lebanon.\u000a\u000aAccording to Axios, Netanyahu has told his top defense and intelligence leadership that his country should \u201cmake every effort not to get dragged into the escalation in the Gulf and would not interfere directly in the situation.\u201d So Israel, along with the United Arab Emirates, has backed off its openly hawkish Iran stances so as not to spark a war right now.\u000a\u000aRussia and European countries, especially those still party to the Iran nuclear deal, are also working as go-betweens to end the standoff. Experts also say that European nations worry greatly about millions of refugees streaming into the continent if a war with Iran breaks out, which would put immense pressure on governments already dealing with the fallout of the Syrian refugee crisis.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s bad news for Bolton and others who might want a full-on war with Iran. For the US to be successful, it will need political and military support from Israel and Europeans. Without them, the US would struggle to have the international legitimacy and help it needs not only to win the fight but also to deal with the immense fallout.\u000a\u000aBut the US does have some support for a fight. Most of it comes from Saudi Arabia, which has been locked in a decades-long cold war of sorts with Iran for control in the Middle East. Arab News, a Riyadh-aligned newspaper, recently called for the US to launch a \u201csurgical strike\u201d on Iran.\u000a\u000aThat said, Saudi Foreign Affairs Minister Adel al-Jubeir recently told reporters that \u201cthe kingdom of Saudi Arabia does not want war in the region and does not strive for that.\u201d He added: \u201cif the other side chooses war, the kingdom will fight this with all force and determination and it will defend itself, its citizens and its interests.\u201d\u000a\u000aStill, it seems that if the US decided to launch a war with Iran, it would mostly do so alone. That must surely give even those itching for a fight in the Trump administration some pause.\u000a\u000aNot really, no. \u201cThere are valid concerns that some in the administration are casting intelligence in a certain light to further their goals of regime change, but I think there are more differences than similarities to Iraq,\u201d says Brewer, who is now at the Center for a New American Security in Washington.\u000a\u000aIn the runup to the Iraq War, George W. Bush\u2019s administration made a clear and repeated case that Saddam Hussein, the country\u2019s brutal dictator, had weapons of mass destruction. The problem is that it was based on cherry-picked intelligence that proved not to be credible, leading the US to launch a war based on faulty information and a misleading public pitch.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere was a serious, coordinated effort by the Bush administration \u2014 via major speeches, interviews, etc. \u2014 to lay out its case for war. None of that appears to be happening now,\u201d Brewer told me.\u000a\u000aStill, there\u2019s a good reason some compare the current Iran moment to the previous Iraq one. You have a Republican administration, featuring some of the same figures who pushed the US to war in Iraq (namely, Bolton), saying it has intelligence showing an imminent threat against Americans. With reports showing that Trump\u2019s team might be inflating what Iran is really up to, it\u2019s no wonder eyebrows and goosebumps are raising across the country.\u000a\u000aSo let\u2019s be clear about what we actually know \u2014 that is, what reports say the US has found:\u000a\u000aExperts are mostly unanimous in believing that intelligence like this exists and is credible. Where they differ is on just how much it clearly shows a new level of Iranian aggression.\u000a\u000aPhillip Smyth, an Iran expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told me that major threats from Tehran\u2019s proxies have continued since early 2018. \u201cThere have been maneuvers in the past that sent a signal to the Americans\u201d of a worsening regional situation, he said.\u000a\u000aBut he noted that just because there are indications that an attack could happen doesn\u2019t mean an Iranian proxy will launch one soon. \u201cThese guys are very smart and very patient with how they plan and execute,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aOthers, like Brookings\u2019s Maloney, have said that people shouldn\u2019t assume the intelligence is bogus, mainly because Iran would likely retaliate forcefully to the Trump administration\u2019s antagonism.\u000a\u000aWhat gives many pause, though, is that there seems to be a difference in what the US and its allies glean from the intelligence. For example, a top British military official involved in the coalition fight against ISIS in Iraq told Pentagon reporters last week that the threats weren\u2019t extraordinary.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, a bipartisan group of senators met with White House officials last Thursday to learn more about the Iran intelligence. The lawmakers didn\u2019t offer much to the press after leaving, but Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that \u201cit\u2019s very important that more members hear this story.\u201d\u000a\u000aUS defense and intelligence officials familiar with the information wouldn\u2019t provide me with any more information than is already public.\u000a\u000aWhat makes this different from the Iraq War, then, is that both Congress and the press are refusing to take the administration\u2019s claims at face value, and instead are pushing the Trump administration to back up those claims with actual proof.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe learned, sadly, in Iraq, when things are done behind closed doors, when the American people aren\u2019t fully informed, it can lead to significant foreign policy blunders,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Thursday before the intelligence briefing.\u000a\u000aPretty much anytime talk of America going to war in the Middle East comes up, people wonder if it\u2019s merely a quest to control more oil. That\u2019s fair to an extent, as the US and other world powers have launched wars to take charge of energy sources.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s not really the case here. What the US does care about, though, is ensuring that vessels are allowed to sail freely through the Strait of Hormuz, which about 40 percent of the world\u2019s oil ships through. When US-Iran tensions spike, Iran typically threatens to shut down the strait.\u000a\u000aDoing so would send the global energy market into a tailspin and cause a worldwide crisis.\u000a\u000aBut Iran doesn\u2019t usually follow through with its bluster, surely aware of the fury it would face from the United States and others. So when news of the mystery attacks on oil tankers near the strait broke last week, it raised worries that Tehran may have found a way to send a message (though, again, Iran denies having anything to do with the sabotage). The drone attacks on Saudi\u2019s oil pipeline by Iran-backed rebels in Yemen didn\u2019t quell concerns, either.\u000a\u000a\u201cBy signaling that this supply is not safe and can be disrupted, Tehran is letting the world know it has escalation options,\u201d says Behnam Ben Taleblu, an expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank.\u000a\u000aBut while the continued supply of cheap oil is definitely important to the US, it\u2019s not really the reason some in the Trump administration are pushing for an Iran fight today. That really comes down to this: Bolton, Pompeo, and others want regime change in Iran, and are using intelligence that shows Tehran doing provocative things to advocate for a more combative stance.\u000a\u000aThe hope now is that Trump continues to keep them at arm\u2019s length. A source told me that the president is already calling friends to complain about Bolton and even asking about who might be a good replacement.\u000a\u000aWhich means that war with Iran remains an unlikely possibility \u2014 at least for now.
