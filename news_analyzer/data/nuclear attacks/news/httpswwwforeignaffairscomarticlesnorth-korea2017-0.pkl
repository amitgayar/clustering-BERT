VThe biggest change that U.S. President Donald Trump has brought to North Korea policy is rhetorical\u2014but the strategic implications may be huge. In terms of actual policy, the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cstrategic accountability\u201d owes more to the Barack Obama administration\u2019s \u201cstrategic patience\u201d than either its architects or its critics might like to admit.

The crisis, which bubbled over for a year, was deflated by a fit of diplomacy that led to the U.S.-DPRK Agreed Framework, which froze North Korea\u2019s plutonium program and later enabled a moratorium on missile tests.
