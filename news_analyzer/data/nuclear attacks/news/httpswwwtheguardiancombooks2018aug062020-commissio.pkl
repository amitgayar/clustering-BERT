VReflecting on US nostalgia for music from past wars, the musician and satirist Tom Lehrer once joked: \u201cI feel that if any songs are going to come out of World War III, we\u2019d better start writing them now.\u201d\u000a\u000aThose whose job it is to contemplate the likelihood and impact of nuclear war feel the same way about postmortems. Trying to explain what went wrong after a thermo-nuclear conflict kills millions is the ultimate in futility \u2013 a stable door closed after all the horses have bolted and the stable burned to the ground.\u000a\u000aThe 2020 Commission Report on the North Korean Nuclear Attacks Against the United States is an attempt to give us hindsight before it\u2019s too late. It calls itself a speculative novel, a horrific imagined future based on a quite plausible extrapolation of the present. Its author and the author of the imagined commission report that provides the book\u2019s format are one and the same. Jeffrey Lewis is one of the world\u2019s leading experts on the North Korean nuclear weapons programme. His team at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey has played an important role in revealing the extent of that programme through the analysis of satellite images and North Korea\u2019s own messaging. It is quite likely that if the worst happened, Lewis would be summoned by an investigative commission seeking to determine what had gone so disastrously wrong.\u000a\u000aAt the high tide of optimism surrounding Donald Trump\u2019s June summit with Kim Jong-un in Singapore, Lewis was one of the most persistent voices warning of the dangers of Trump\u2019s unrealistic expectations based on a misunderstanding of the North Korean regime. When Kim agreed to \u201cdenuclearisation of the Korean peninsula\u201d, he was not offering unilateral disarmament, Lewis pointed out, but repeating a stock phrase used by the regime for more than two decades to describe a drawn-out and mutual process in which the US would be doing a lot of the disarming.\u000a\u000aThe warnings of Lewis and others are now being borne out. Kim has made it quite clear that he is keeping his arsenal. Trump is in denial of that fact. In The 2020 Commission, Lewis imagines what could happen when denial is no longer possible and Trump goes looking for others to blame. He fires his secretary of state, national security adviser and White House chief of staff in a single tweet, announcing: \u201cTomorrow we announce a new national security team! Going to the mattress!\u201d Above all, Trump blames Kim, and resumes his campaign of tweeted schoolboy insults about \u201cthat SHORT and FAT kid\u201d and \u201cLittle Rocketman\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe commission, interviewing survivors and poring over the official records in a Virginia bunker in the aftermath of the 2020 cataclysm, describes the relentless unravelling of the situation. Pyongyang resumes nuclear and missile tests. The US military resumes joint military exercises and ramps them up, adding a covert element \u2013 a series of bomber sorties designed to unnerve the North Koreans, flying right up to the demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas before banking away at the last moment. It was a tactic that had seemed to work against the Soviet Union, at least in the eyes of the US air force.\u000a\u000aThe spark to this conflagration-in-waiting is a glitch on a South Korean commercial airliner that knocks out its navigation system for a couple of minutes, enough to carry it close to the DMZ, before being rerouted. The airbus\u2019s consequent course looks to North Korean air defence very much like another US bomber run. The plane carrying 228 passengers, nearly half of them children on a school exchange programme, is shot down, triggering reaction, counter-reaction and miscalculation that leaves millions dead in North and South Korea, Japan and the US, over the space of four days in March 2020. The South Koreans hit back for the downing of the plane with a salvo of missiles. Kim, convinced he is under attack, hits back with nuclear weapons against Seoul, Japan and US bases in the region. The US retaliates with air strikes on military targets and Kim\u2019s palaces, prompting him to unleash nuclear ICBMs against the US mainland. The US obliterates the North Korean army in a 48-hour blitz but it is too late to prevent the worst calamity in US history.\u000a\u000aAs the events accelerate, Lewis deftly relaxes the constraints he has imposed on his story by telling it through the words of an official report, allowing the narrative to take on the pace of a thriller without breaking with the form. He transposes eyewitness accounts of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, putting them in the mouths of the survivors from New York and the Washington suburbs who come to tell their story to the commission. He faces the challenge of many who spend their lives thinking about nuclear weapons \u2013 how to bring their ever-present danger to the attention of a complacent public who assume they will never be used. There are few people left even in the top reaches of government who are fully aware of how often the world came within a hair\u2019s breadth of catastrophe in the cold war through human and machine error.\u000a\u000aIn its efforts to tug at the sleeve of a blithe nation, Lewis\u2019s book follows in the post-apocalyptic footsteps of Nevil Shute\u2019s On the Beach or the 1983 film The Day After. In its black comedy, which surfaces in the deadpan prose of the report, it is a Dr Strangelove for our time. Trump is as flamboyantly grotesque a character as any cooked up by Stanley Kubrick and Peter Sellers.\u000a\u000aThe nuclear war predictably starts with a tweet. Kim becomes convinced he is about to be killed and decides to launch his nuclear weapons after reading a classic Trump caps-lock exclamation, casually sent from Mar-a-Lago declaring: \u201cLITTLE ROCKET MAN WON\u2019T BE BOTHERING US MUCH LONGER!\u201d Once the missiles are in the air and Trump is yanked away from lunch with his golfing buddies, he makes a lunge for the nuclear \u201cfootball\u201d, the satchel containing the launch codes for US missiles. After a tussle, his military aide flees the scene with the football, alarmed by Trump\u2019s apparent determination to attack China as well as North Korea. The president lies sprawling on the ground, humiliated and surly. In a funk, he flies off in Air Force One, leaving his senior staff behind to face an incoming North Korean ICBM hurtling towards Mar-a-Lago. Looking out at the mushroom cloud from his window seat, Trump can only murmur: \u201cAbsolutely beautiful.\u201d It is a measure of the insanity of the past 18 months that this seems entirely believable.\u000a\u000aIn an aftermath that is even more partisan and toxic than what came before, with former president Trump denouncing the commission (inevitably) as \u201ca total witch hunt\u201d and fake news, the commission shies away from assigning blame, concluding that administration officials \u201cmade the best decisions they could with the information that was available to them at the time\u201d.\u000a\u000aWhat Lewis clearly aims to drive home is that many of the steps that led to war are rooted in pre-Trump orthodoxy. Heavy bombers have been permanently stationed in Guam since 2004 and their practice sorties to the Korean peninsula have been made public since 2013. Since he inherited power in 2011, US intelligence assessments have concluded that Kim Jong-un is a rational actor, and policymakers have reasoned that he would never do anything as suicidal as start a nuclear war.\u000a\u000aLewis believes that could be flawed logic. His view is that the North Korean leader, faced with the threat of regime change, is likely to see a nuclear strike on US forces in the region as his best hope of survival, betting that the US would not persevere and risk the destruction of American cities.\u000a\u000aThe inescapable conclusion of The 2020 Commission is that the potential for catastrophe is already baked into the military logic pursued by both sides. In other words, we were already drifting towards the abyss even before Trump seized the helm.\u000a\u000a\u2022 The 2020 Commission Report on the North Korean Nuclear Attacks Against the United States by Jeffrey Lewis is published by WH Allen (£9.99).
