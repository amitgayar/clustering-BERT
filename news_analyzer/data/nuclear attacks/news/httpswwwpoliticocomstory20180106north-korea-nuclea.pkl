VU.S. military officials increasingly worry that a mistake or miscommunication \u2014 even more than an intentional act of war \u2014 could start a nuclear conflict in Korea.\u000a\u000aA North Korean provocation, a U.S. warning shot, malicious hackers or a simple accident could be the cause that starts a new war between two nations with a long history of tensions and suspicion.\u000a\u000a"Miscalculation is now at a stage [that is] higher than probably any time since the Cuban missile crisis," former Obama administration Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said days after President Donald Trump boasted on Twitter that his nuclear button is \u201ca much bigger & more powerful one\u201d than Kim Jong Un\u2019s.\u000a\u000aThese are some of the potential scenarios that most worry former nuclear commanders, policymakers and experts on Korea.\u000a\u000aA common fear of escalation is rooted in the oft-violent history of the Korean standoff, which dates back to the 1953 armistice that halted the three years of fighting in the Korean War. The two sides have come to blows or awfully close countless times in the decades since then \u2014 often by "pure accident," in the words of Michael Mazarr, who served as special assistant to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2008 to 2010 and is a specialist on the Asia-Pacific.\u000a\u000aIn one prominent case, a U.S. Army helicopter strayed across the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea and was shot down in 1994, killing one crew member.\u000a\u000aIn other cases, the close proximity of opposing militaries \u2014 positioned just across from each other at the Demilitarized Zone \u2014 have come dangerously close to military confrontation by accident.\u000a\u000aFor example, in 2003, four North Korean fighter jets buzzed an unarmed American spy plane over the Sea of Japan, coming within 50 feet of the U.S. aircraft. In 2015, two South Korean soldiers stumbled on land mines planted near the DMZ by the North, and both sides separately exchanged mortar and artillery fire. North and South Korean forces also exchanged gunfire just last month when a North Korean soldier defected to the south.\u000a\u000aGiven the current tensions on the peninsula, any type of mishap or misstep could escalate quickly, numerous experts say.\u000a\u000aMazarr said one such scenario could be a North Korean missile test gone awry.\u000a\u000a"North Korea launches a missile that they presume to be a test, it malfunctions and starts going toward Japan in a way that is perceived as a possible attack, so the U.S. takes out the launch pad and then it just escalates from there," he said.\u000a\u000aKelsey Davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association, a Washington think tank, also raised the prospect that North Korea could misinterpret a flyover by a U.S. bomber \u2014 a practice the Pentagon uses from time to time simply to show resolve \u2014 as a pre-emptive attack.\u000a\u000aAbraham Denmark, a former deputy assistant defense secretary for East Asia, recalled such a flyover in September that traveled farther north than previous American exercises. It took place just a few days after Trump warned in a speech before the United Nations that the United States might have no choice but to "totally destroy" North Korea.\u000a\u000aHe said such rhetoric "puts normal actions in a different light," expressing concern that in such circumstances North Korea's military could fatally misread the U.S. flexing its military muscles.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe North Koreans have also shown a pattern of staging military provocations against the U.S. or South Korea \u2014 while gambling that they won't trigger a wider conflict.\u000a\u000aThe most prominent example occurred in 1968, when North Korea attacked and captured the USS Pueblo, a Navy spy ship with 83 crew members, who were held in captivity for nearly a year. As recently as 2010, North Korea torpedoed and sank a South Korean warship in the Yellow Sea, killing 46 South Korea sailors.\u000a\u000aGiven the rhetoric on both sides of the DMZ, where the United States has nearly 30,000 troops, many experts fear that such a provocation could now more easily devolve into something far larger.\u000a\u000a"They could make the miscalculation and something like 2010 happens again," said Denmark, who is now director of the Asia program at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. "I believe the U.S. and South Korean actions would be very different than 2010."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMazarr said "the most likely route to a big war" is a decision by the United States "to take military action it believes will be small."\u000a\u000aIndeed, more hawkish voices in the United States have been talking up the value of launching a pre-emptive U.S. military strike \u2014 what some news reports have called a "bloody nose" attack \u2014 to curtail North Korea's advancing nuclear program. That has set off alarms among numerous North Korea experts that the Trump administration may not fully think through the implications.\u000a\u000a"The United States could take what it viewed as a limited military action, but it would be extraordinarily difficult to control the escalation after such an action because North Korea would be under tremendous pressure to respond militarily," said Davenport.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea, despite its large army and advancing missile and cyber capabilities, also lacks the intelligence skills to reliably gauge a relatively limited U.S. assault on its own.\u000a\u000a"It is difficult for them potentially to distinguish a large-scale disarming strike from the beginning of an all-out war," said Mazarr, who is now a senior political scientist at the government-funded Rand Corp. specializing in nuclear deterrence. "Such a strike would likely require attacks on air defenses, air fields, command and control facilities."\u000a\u000aTo the North Koreans, that could be reminiscent of the beginning of the United States' Desert Storm attack on Iraq in 1991 \u2014 leading them to conclude that American troops would soon be landing. If they believe that, Mazarr said, they might decide at some point that "you know, it\u2019s time to launch everything."\u000a\u000aThen you have what quickly becomes a very big war, he added.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMoniz, who now heads the nonprofit Nuclear Threat Initiative, said he especially worries about the potential for nuclear war should another malign actor do something that one side either misinterprets or wrongly blames on the other. Examples could include a hacker infiltrating North Korean or American communication systems inputting false data or rendering them inoperable and feeding suspicions that a full-blown attack is imminent.\u000a\u000a"We have historically, of course, seen how incorrect information in both the Soviet Union and the United States led to a major risk of a nuclear exchange," he said, citing the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.\u000a\u000aIt was learned after the crisis that U.S. military officials who unsuccessfully advocated for an invasion of Cuba were unaware at the time that the Soviet Union had given orders to use battlefield nuclear weapons placed on the island.\u000a\u000a"We have today an additional possible source of incorrect information," Moniz added: "cyberattacks on nuclear command and control systems, which could be from a third party."\u000a\u000aThe United States would have good reason to believe such an attack could be the work of North Korea, he said, even if it isn't.\u000a\u000a"We know that North Korea has developed and we have seen the impact of their development of cyberattack tools," Moniz said. "Cyberattacks on nuclear command and control systems is something we need to get our hands around."\u000a\u000aJon Wolfsthal, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who held the nuclear portfolio on the National Security Council during the Obama administration, also expressed concern about the "third-party actor" scenario.\u000a\u000a"There's always something that goes wrong that we don't control \u2014 an airliner that strays over North Korean airspace by mistake, a hacker picks the wrong time to try to screw with the North Korean communication system, or the South Korean banking system, or the American radar system in South Korea," Wolfsthal said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTrump's latest tweet, which responded to Kim's claim on New Year's Day that "a nuclear button is always on my desk," alarmed people throughout Washington and foreign capitals \u2014 especially in South Korea, which swiftly sought to open up a new dialogue with its outlaw neighbor.\u000a\u000aTraditionally, the United States has tried to avoid miscommunication with North Korea by using diplomats, unofficial emissaries and public and private messages to engage with Pyongyang. Such messages are first carefully distilled by multiple government agencies and allies, said retired Marine Gen. James Cartwright, a former top U.S. nuclear commander.\u000a\u000aBut with Trump and Kim, he said, \u201cyou are dealing with two people who are matching wills." And Trump is doing it via Twitter.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is pretty hard to go to all-out war,\u201d Cartwright added. "But it is real easy to miscalculate in those kinds of one-versus-one dialogues."\u000a\u000aAfter the latest round of tweets, top Trump administration officials once again stressed publicly that they would far prefer a diplomatic solution to North Korea's nuclear ambitions. So did the United States Pacific Command, which would have to fight such a war, telling POLITICO that "diplomacy continues to remains the preferred course of action toward the peaceful de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration has also taken a step that could ease tensions somewhat, announcing Thursday it will delay an annual military exercise in the region until after the upcoming Winter Olympics in South Korea. North Korea has denounced those exercises as threatening.\u000a\u000aEven so, a blunder into war always remains possible because U.S. and allied intelligence agencies understand little about North Korea and its leaders \u2014 and because their militaries communicate only rarely.\u000a\u000a"The challenge here is how little we know about what North Korean senior leaders actually think, what they believe about U.S. intentions, what they are thinking on a day-to-day basis,\u201d Mazarr said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the kind of published military doctrine that you could look at with Russia or China to sort of say how would they react to certain circumstances."\u000a\u000aIn contrast, the U.S. and the Soviet Union set up what Mazarr called "a lot of buffers\u201d during the latter years of the Cold War, establishing procedures for mutual communication, military-to-military discussions and personal relationships among diplomats.\u000a\u000aWith North Korea, "if there were a helicopter that went down or a boat that had entered the wrong zone at the wrong time or some training crew with their mortar going in the wrong direction, there is no way to communicate quickly or reliably that that is a mistake," Wolfsthal said.\u000a\u000aHe added, "When we make outlandish threats, the North Koreans are going to be a little more on edge, and they have a very strong incentive to use their nuclear weapons first."\u000a\u000aThe threats that Trump and Kim are lobbing add unnecessary fuel to an already dicey situation, say those with direct experience managing the U.S. nuclear arsenal.\u000a\u000a\u201cWords matter," said retired Air Force Gen. C. Robert Kehler, who oversaw the American nuclear arsenal as commander of the U.S. Strategic Command from 2011 to 2013. "And the U.S. has always been cautious in our rhetoric involving nuke weapons in particular."
