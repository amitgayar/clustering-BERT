VIt comes as the US deployed a nuclear submarine to the Korean Peninsula in a series of military drills with South Korea amid fears tensions will escalate into World War 3. Kim Jong-un\u2019s mouthpiece, the Korean Central News Agency, blasted the drills as a \u201csinister scenario to provoke a nuclear war by all means\u201d and vowed that North Korea will hit back if the US destroyed their nuclear facilities. Referring the despotic nation by its North Korean abbreviation, it said: \u201cThe US reckless military gambling against DPRK may lead to its total destruction. \u201cThe DPRK is ready to counter the war of aggression with a war of justice and cope with the enemy's dagger with a sword and his rifle with an artillery piece.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is the invariable stand of the Korean army and people and their permanent mode of counteraction.\u201d KCNA also lashed out at reports the Trump administration are considering deploying smaller tactical nuclear weapons to the region.  It added: \u201cThis sheds light on the sinister scenario to provoke a nuclear war by all means so as to totally destroy the DPRK and exterminate the population of the north. \u201cNow, the Korean Peninsula is on the threshold of a nuclear disaster and no one knows at what time a thermonuclear war will break out.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Trump group should think twice about what terrible consequences the US will face due to its scheme for a nuclear attack on the DPRK.\u201d It comes as North Korea\u2019s UN ambassador Kim In Ryong warned that the situation "has reached the touch-and-go point and a nuclear war may break out any moment\u201d. Kim Jong-un\u2019s representative told the UN General Assembly's disarmament committee that no country in the world except North Korea has been subjected to "such an extreme and direct nuclear threat from the US" \u2014 and claimed his country has the right to self-defence. He added that North Korea had now bcome a "full-fledged nuclear power which possesses the delivery means of various ranges, including the atomic bomb, H-bomb and intercontinental ballistic rockets\u201d.\u000a\u000aKim also warned that "the entire US mainland is within our firing range" and if the Washington invades "it will not escape our severe punishment in any part of the globe\u201d. Propaganda posters released to South Korea by the North also depicted missiles pointed at the US Government\u2019s Capitol Building and a North Korean soldier stamping on what appears to be Donald Trump\u2019s decapitated head.  Experts yesterday warned the US Government that North Korea could obliterate 90 per cent of the USA if Kim Jong-un detonates a deadly nuclear electromagnetic pulse (EMP) bomb. Dr William R Graham and Dr Peter Vincent Pry, from the EMP Commission, told the US Hose of Representatives that fridges, lights, water and communication devices would become void if a hydrogen bomb detonated at an altitude of 30 to 400km above a target.\u000a\u000aAnd the blast could end up killing 90 per cent of American indirectly, along with taking down aeroplanes in flight and cause trains to stop in their tracks. US general Barry McCaffrey, who is reportedly known for his measured comments, also claimed that the US would be at war with the communist regime "by next summer" during a TV interview with NBC. The former US Army general said: "The problem is we\u2019ve got so many crises going on now, potentially, that he\u2019s overloading the diplomatic effort, as well as the US armed forces\u2019 ability to deal with it. "I don\u2019t want us to take our eye off North Korea.
