VEveryone from Former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and President Vladimir Putin to Steve Bannon and China agree: war with North Korea would be so horrific that it simply can\u2019t happen. Up to one million people could die on the first day of such a war. At that rate, it would take two months to match the death toll of the whole of World War II.\u000a\u000aAccording to Paul Edwards, an international security expert at Stanford University, the effect of a major nuclear war would be comparable to the \u201cgiant meteor believed to be responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs.\u201d Leading researchers Alan Robock and Owen Toon warn that even \u201ca regional conflict has the potential to cause mass starvation worldwide.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf it wasn\u2019t for Donald Trump\u2019s threatening rhetoric, his continual sabotage of diplomatic efforts, and his personal insults directed at Kim Jong-Un, the U.S. would not be on the verge of war. No other American president has elevated tensions so dramatically, but Trump shows no signs of changing track.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, the U.S. still has alternatives: despite numerous reports to the contrary, North Korea has said they would be willing to negotiate about their nuclear program if the U.S. stops threatening to destroy it. In that case, what can be done to build pressure inside the U.S. to pursue a peaceful solution to the crisis, and how can ordinary people help?\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s here that historical precedent may be useful. When we reflect on the Holocaust, for example, we tend to vilify prominent Nazi leaders like Adolf Eichmann who were \u201cjust following orders,\u201d while extolling ordinary citizens like Oskar Schindler who used creative strategies to prevent atrocities.\u000a\u000aFew of us believe we would have behaved like Eichmann. Many of us would like to think we would have acted like Schindler, and hundreds of others who have developed non-violent resistance when faced by the prospect of war and large-scale killing. The choice we face is the same today\u2014and we have the strategies and tactics to make nonviolence work. But first we have to recognize the seriousness and urgency of the situation.\u000a\u000aSeveral indicators suggest that Trump could be preparing to initiate a pre-emptive strike against North Korea in the second half of November.\u000a\u000aFirst, according to the State Department, he has already said that he would launch a first strike if North Korea developed the capacity to deliver nuclear warheads to the continental United States. Last week, CIA Director Mike Pompeo announced that North Korea is \u201con the cusp\u201d of achieving that goal and \u201cit's now a matter of thinking about how do [sic] you stop the final step.\u201d Pompeo\u2019s statement is consistent with earlier predictions that North Korea would develop such capabilities by early 2018.\u000a\u000aSecond, in early October Japan\u2019s Minister of Defense, Itsunori Onodera, implied to reporters in Tokyo that Trump would initiate military action in mid-November unless North Korea complies with US demands.\u000a\u000aThird, back in August of 2017, U.S. military officials said that they needed a few months to prepare logistically for war. Then they began preparations. This timeline suggests that they will be ready to carry out a first strike in November.\u000a\u000aFourth, on October 20th 2017, Trump declared a national state of emergency and legalized a limited military draft.\u000a\u000aEven GOP members are reportedly \u201cpraying Trump doesn\u2019t do something really, really stupid,\u201d according to a former Republican member of Congress who wants to remain anonymous. His former colleagues have said that they would support Trump\u2019s removal\u2014potentially by invoking the 25th amendment to the U.S. Constitution\u2014if the leadership of the Republican Party gave \u201cthe signal to everyone they can bail.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt seems that in this process, Republicans are just \u2018obeying orders\u2019\u2014as with Eichmann\u2019s defense of his actions in World War II. Perhaps they need a reminder that the judge in Eichmann\u2019s trial ruled that \u201cblind obedience\u201d made him no less culpable when he found him guilty of war crimes.\u000a\u000aNone of these developments guarantee that nuclear war is imminent, or that a preemptive strike against North Korea would necessarily be judged a war crime, but they do suggest that such a strike is highly plausible, if not probable. The stakes are high enough to make all Americans take the threat of war very seriously, and to organize immediately to prevent it. Yet large-scale activism has failed to materialize thus far. Why?\u000a\u000aThe first problem is that there is little sense of urgency, largely because government officials never offer a time frame for when they expect hostilities to break out. It\u2019s easy to become complacent when you\u2019ve been hearing that we are \u201con the brink of war\u201d for months.\u000a\u000aA good example of this problem in another area was the failure of activists to mobilize people in response to the May 4, 2017 House of Representatives vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), despite successfully doing so around other votes to repeal the ACA both before and afterwards.\u000a\u000aWhat made the difference? The May 4th vote wasn\u2019t scheduled until one day before it took place, so people didn\u2019t \u201crealize how close the GOP [was] to repealing," and therefore it \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like we were in an emergency,\u201d according to Moveon.org\u2019s Ben Wikler.\u000a\u000aConversely, a clear timeframe was a major factor behind one the biggest success stories in terms of resistance against the Nazis. In Denmark, 95 percent of the local Jewish population survived, in part because a German diplomat leaked the Nazi\u2019s plan to remove them to death camps three days before the projected start date of the operation. That information was widely disseminated through the Danish population, who then organized to help the vast majority of Jews escape to Sweden in the span of 72 hours.\u000a\u000aThe second problem is insufficient awareness about the potential consequences of nuclear war. According to Alan Robock\u2019s research, \u201cmost people, including high-ranking defense officials, are unaware that a nuclear war occurring halfway around the world\u2026could seriously harm the homeland.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven Schindler didn\u2019t act until he fully understood the magnitude of the Holocaust. In fact he was a member of the Nazi party himself, and only began his efforts to save Jews after he began witnessing atrocities against them.\u000a\u000aThird, there is no consensus on the best way to prevent a war. While there is general agreement that Trump is responsible for escalating tensions with North Korea, opinions are divided as to the best solution, and most of the suggestions that have been made are unviable.\u000a\u000aMany groups and individuals\u2014including most recently Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2014have advocated for legislation that would prevent Trump from launching a nuclear strike unilaterally. While such laws would (theoretically) pry Trump\u2019s finger off the nuclear trigger, they won\u2019t stop him from escalating tensions to breaking point.\u000a\u000aThere have also been increasing efforts to instigate an impeachment process (so far with little sign of the necessary Republican support), but even if proceedings were initiated now, Trump would still have plenty of time to launch a nuclear strike. War could start in as little as four to six weeks, whereas historical precedent suggests that impeachment would take several months: President Clinton's impeachment process took over four months, and Andrew Johnson's more than three.\u000a\u000aThe only remaining viable option is invoking the 25th amendment, which would remove Trump immediately, but that would still require the support of either a majority of Congress or Trump\u2019s cabinet, as well as Vice President Mike Pence. Pence\u2019s acquiescence might not be as difficult as some imagine, especially under pressure from both the American public and Congress. Invoking the 25th would satisfy Pence\u2019s presidential ambitions, not to mention his suspected deep-seated but carefully concealed resentment of Trump.\u000a\u000aEven in this scenario, large-scale public pressure would be vital, so what kinds of actions might help to create it?\u000a\u000aThe efficacy of activism is not predicated on the size of a protest crowd, but on the leverage that the public exerts on decision-makers\u2019 interests. Members of Congress care about their re-election. Organizing locally and holding representatives individually accountable can be effective because they are afraid of losing the support of the people who would be voting for them in the next election.\u000a\u000aThe grassroots activism that\u2014so far\u2014has prevented Congress from axing Obamacare is a great example of this strategy in action. Even though Republicans had spent eight years swearing to \u2018repeal and replace\u2019 the Affordable Care Act, many of them retracted their support because thousands of their constituents called their offices, turned up at town hall meetings, and publically embarrassed them.\u000a\u000aThe obedience of Republicans in Congress is always politically motivated, since they fear that moving outside of party lines will cost them their jobs. But if they think that their obedience will actually lose them the next election they will be less likely to follow in Eichmann\u2019s footsteps. That\u2019s why large-scale public pressure is the key to preventing nuclear war.
