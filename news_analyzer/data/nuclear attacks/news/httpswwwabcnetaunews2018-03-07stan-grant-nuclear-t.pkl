VRead the headlines and you'd be forgiven for thinking we have been transported back in time.\u000a\u000aTrade wars, spies poisoned, a new Mao Zedong back in power in China, Russian meddling in foreign elections and a threat of nuclear war: it reads like a page torn from a newspaper in the 1970s at the height of the Cold War.\u000a\u000aThe threat of terrorism has been replaced with an even greater fear: the return of big power rivalry, the risk of nation-on-nation conflict, even nuclear war.\u000a\u000aTerrorism was never the scourge of our age: devastating, yes; unpredictable; global in its reach as still ever present, but dwarfed by the potential for conflict that could cost tens of millions of lives; send the world economy into a tailspin and alter our destiny.\u000a\u000aNations talk less about disarmament \u2014 now they boast of their nuclear capacity and are ramping up to use it.\u000a\u000aUS intelligence believes North Korea could have as many as 60 nuclear bombs and has now tested missiles that could deliver them as far away as the United States or Australia.\u000a\u000aKim Jong-un threatens to turn Asia into a sea of fire, while Donald Trump openly mocks North Korea's leader as "little rocket man", warning him that Washington's nuclear button is bigger than Pyongyang's.\u000a\u000aAround the world the risk of a nuclear breakout is growing.\u000a\u000aIran has done a deal to wind back its nuclear ambitions in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions \u2014 a bombs-for-cash swap \u2014 that critics say only delays the inevitable: it will eventually be a nuclear-armed state.\u000a\u000aSaudi Arabia, in a deep power struggle with Iran, would likely follow.\u000a\u000aPakistan and India are locked in a nuclear-armed existential stand off.\u000a\u000aJapan is the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack twice, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and it has no plans to develop a nuclear weapons program. It has a pacifist constitution and is protected under America's "nuclear umbrella".\u000a\u000aBut Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expanding military spending and moving to reset his country's military posture as the regional threats grow. There are big "ifs", but analysts believe Japan would have enough nuclear material and knowhow to fast-track the bomb.\u000a\u000aThe threat remains, too, of nuclear terrorism: a crude device \u2014 a dirty bomb \u2014 that could fall into the hands of militant groups.\u000a\u000aLast week, Vladimir Putin, fired what some have called the first shot in a new nuclear arms race, using his state of the nation speech to talk up his "invincible" new nuclear arsenal.\u000a\u000aThe Russian president is driven by fear that his country is "falling behind". He is playing catch-up and says his new weapons can evade American missile defences.\u000a\u000aMr Putin's address was part show-and-tell; it came with its own video of a Russian cruise missile strike on what looked like the US state of Florida.\u000a\u000aIn a two-hour speech, Putin devoted more than half an hour to his nuclear arsenal, telling the Russian people: "We must take ownership of our destiny."\u000a\u000aHe said that Russia is "not threatening anyone, not going to attack anyone". But, he added, "I hope that everything that was said today would make any potential aggressor think twice... Russia is ready for this."\u000a\u000aMr Putin was responding to developments in American missile defence systems that he sees aimed at Russia.\u000a\u000aThe recently released US Nuclear Posture Review identified Russia as a competitor: it has more nuclear weapons than other potential threats, China and North Korea.\u000a\u000aThe review seeks to increase America's capacity and broaden the trigger for use of nuclear weapons.\u000a\u000aIt stresses that the US "would only consider the employment of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances", but those circumstances now included "non-nuclear strategic attacks".\u000a\u000aThe Bulletin of Atomic Scientists says "the tone of the new report is alarming about the security environment, arms control efforts are sidelined, and modernisations and new weapons systems have been brought to the forefront".\u000a\u000aVladimir Putin has recast the global balance of power.\u000a\u000aHis interventions in Ukraine, Crimea and Syria have challenged Western powers.\u000a\u000aThe US National Security Strategy released in December 2017, names Russia \u2014 along with China \u2014 as challenging "American power, influence and interests, attempting to erode American security and prosperity".\u000a\u000aThe strategy says the two countries are a threat to freedom and fairness as they "grow their militaries" and "repress their societies and expand their influence".\u000a\u000aMr Putin presents himself to his people as a strongman standing up to the West. He laments the end of the Soviet empire and rejects any expansion of NATO power into his sphere of influence.\u000a\u000aIn a recent essay in The American Interest journal, Peter Doran and Donald Jensen, both from the Centre for European Policy Analysis, said: "Kremlin leaders still regard themselves as players in a great-power competition with the United States and Europe. And they harbour a grudge: they believe that the international system treats them unjustly."\u000a\u000aMr Putin, they say, has embarked on a "strategy of chaos", sowing instability to enhance Russia's own security.\u000a\u000aMr Doran and Mr Jensen argue that Russia need not defeat the Western powers, only "keep them confused, uncoordinated, and off-balance". This is Mr Putin's tactic, from intervention in the Middle East, allegedly meddling in foreign elections, to boosting his nuclear firepower.\u000a\u000aMr Putin's "chaos strategy" masks fundamental weakness: Russia's had a troubled economy and deep social problems, its military has been dismissed as second rate.\u000a\u000aYet, as former US secretary of state Condoleeza Rice and former defence secretary Robert Gates wrote together in 2015: "Putin is playing a weak hand extraordinarily well because he knows exactly what he wants to do."\u000a\u000aThe days of Russia laying claim to being a superpower are past, but Mr Putin believes it still is, and he says he has the nuclear weapons to back it up.\u000a\u000aMatter of Fact with Stan Grant is on the ABC News Channel at 9pm, Monday to Thursday.
