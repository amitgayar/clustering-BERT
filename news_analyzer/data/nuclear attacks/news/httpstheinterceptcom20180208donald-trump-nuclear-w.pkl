V\u201cImagine, if you dare \u2026 imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis,\u201d Hillary Clinton said in her speech to the Democratic National Convention in 2016, referring to her then-Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump. \u201cA man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.\u201d\u000a\u000aYet four months later, in November 2016, almost 63 million of her fellow Americans voted to put the short-tempered, thin-skinned former reality TV star in charge of their country\u2019s 6,800 nuclear warheads. Never forget: As president of the nuclear-armed United States, Trump \u2014 Trump! \u2014 has the power to destroy humanity many times over, while rendering the planet uninhabitable in the process.\u000a\u000aIf that wasn\u2019t terrifying enough, last week, less than 72 hours after the State of the Union speech, in which Trump ramped up his war of words with North Korea, his administration announced that it wanted to make it much easier for the president to start a nuclear holocaust.\u000a\u000aYou might have missed that rather important piece of news. Last Friday, while cable news channels rolled on the Nunes memo, the Pentagon published the latest Nuclear Posture Review, or NPR, which includes two pretty alarming new components.\u000a\u000aFirst, while Barack Obama\u2019s 2010 NPR for the first time ruled out a nuclear attack against non-nuclear weapon states that are in compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty, Trump\u2019s NPR goes in the opposite direction and suggests that the U.S. could employ nuclear weapons in \u201cextreme circumstances\u201d to defend the \u201cvital interests\u201d of the United States and its allies. The document states:\u000a\u000aGot that? Trump wants to be able to retaliate against a non-nuclear and perhaps even non-military attack on U.S. infrastructure \u2014 say, a cyberattack on the power grid? \u2014 with a nuclear strike that could kill hundreds of thousands, if not millions. To call such a move disproportionate would be a severe understatement.\u000a\u000aSecond, the new NPR calls for the development of a new generation of so-called low-yield nuclear weapons. These smaller nukes, the document suggests, would be tactical, not strategic; deployed to the battlefield, rather than dropped on a city. The problem with this argument is that the atomic bombs used against Hiroshima (200,000 dead) and Nagasaki (70,000 dead) could also be considered low-yield nuclear weapons, in terms of their explosive capacity.\u000a\u000aThere is also the clear lowering of the threshold for nuclear weapons use: It becomes easier to justify the launch of a small nuclear weapon on the basis of a supposedly lower explosive force. Yet \u201ca nuclear weapon is a nuclear weapon,\u201d as Ronald Reagan\u2019s former Secretary of State George Shultz testified in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee the day before the release of Trump\u2019s NPR. \u201cOne of the alarming things to me is this notion that we can have something called a small nuclear weapon \u2026 and that somehow that\u2019s usable,\u201d Shultz added. \u201cYour mind goes to the idea that, yes, nuclear weapons become usable. And then we\u2019re really in trouble, because a big nuclear exchange can wipe out the world.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt would be a worrying development if any president of the United States announced, with little debate or discussion, a plan both to build more tactical nuclear weapons and use them in response to non-nuclear attacks; a nuclear strategy that makes the use of nukes more, not less, likely. But when that president is Donald J. Trump, it should be deemed a national, if not a global, emergency.\u000a\u000aLest we forget, this is a president who, during his election campaign, displayed complete ignorance about the \u201cnuclear triad\u201d; called for an \u201cunpredictable\u201d nuclear weapons policy, while refusing to rule out using nukes against the Islamic State or even in Europe (because \u201cit is a big place\u201d); and asked a foreign policy adviser three times, during a single hourlong briefing, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we use nuclear weapons?\u201d This is a commander-in-chief, who since coming to office a year ago, has demanded a tenfold increase in the number of U.S. nuclear weapons; casually threatened North Korea \u201cwith fire and fury like the world has never seen\u201d; and began 2018 by bragging on Twitter about his \u201cmuch bigger & more powerful\u201d nuclear button.\u000a\u000a\u201cGiving Trump new nukes AND new ways to use them is like giving matches and gasoline to Curious George,\u201d wrote nuclear weapons expert Tom Collina of the Ploughshares Fund on CNN\u2019s website last Friday. \u201cIt will not end well.\u201d Or as one retired senior Army officer told the American Conservative, the NPR provides Trump with \u201ca kind of gateway drug for nuclear war.\u201d\u000a\u000aIndeed. And even prior to the publication of this hawkish nuclear strategy document, a Washington Post-ABC News poll in mid-January revealed that 60 percent of Americans did not trust Trump to responsibly handle his \u201cauthority to order nuclear attacks on other countries,\u201d while 52 percent of them were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d concerned the president \u201cmight launch a nuclear attack without justification.\u201d\u000a\u000aRemember: The courts may be able to strike down his executive orders as unconstitutional, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller may be able to indict him over collusion or obstruction of justice, but there are no checks or balances on the president\u2019s authority to wage nuclear war. None. Zero. To quote Bruce Blair, a former nuclear missile launch officer and research scholar at the Program on Science and Global Security at Princeton University: \u201cWe all need to confront the fact that [the U.S. political system] gives one person the God-like power to end the world.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe questions, therefore, that matter far more than any other in 2018: Does the narcissist-in-chief plan on using this \u201cGod-like power?\u201d Will an impulsive and aggressive Trump get us all killed by launching a nuclear war? Everything else is noise.
