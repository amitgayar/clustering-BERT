VTHE football is interrupted by a warning message as your phone buzzes and tells you to get to cover... the blind panic of an inbound missile attack is hard to imagine.\u000a\u000aHowever, this weekend, Hawaiians didn't have to imagine - they actually lived through the terror of an attack warning, with half an hour between the missile alert kicking in and the reassuring, if late, text saying it was all a mistake and that there was nothing to worry about.\u000a\u000aAnd this morning, Japanese residents were mistakenly warned by text of an impending nuclear attack by North Korea - only for national broadcaster NHK News to go back on its terrifying message moments later.\u000a\u000aWhile America and Japan have their own distinctive alerts, using a combination of text messages, TV bulletins and sirens, every country's missile warning system will be different.\u000a\u000aAnd the incidents in Hawaii and Japan will have many people asking what the UK's own warning system is like.\u000a\u000aWell, the truth is that the government hasn't revealed anything solid about our's current nuclear warning system, but we can piece together a very good idea.\u000a\u000aWe do know that the government has been looking into the feasibility of a text-message warning system, like the one used in Hawaii.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, the Cabinet Office started to test a mobile-phone alert system with a test text sent to 50,000 people.\u000a\u000aHowever, this system was not designed with missile attacks in mind; instead, it was created to provide information around floods or industrial accidents, and has not been implemented at all yet.\u000a\u000aRather than texts, it's more likely that the UK's secretive missile warning system will revolve around more traditional alerts via TV and radio, orchestrated by the BBC.\u000a\u000aOld Cold War plans, which are no longer in use, show how the BBC was poised to take over the airwaves in the event of an attack, broadcasting a chilling "four minute warning" recorded by the late Peter Donaldson, urging Brits to get to shelter.\u000a\u000aProfessor John Preston, a preparedness expert at the University of Essex, told Sun Online that the BBC may be sitting on an updated version of this warning today, ready to beam it out if the worst were to happen.\u000a\u000aHe said: "The BBC has a policy called 'Connecting in a Crisis'. It will have protocols in place but we, as the public, don't know what they are.\u000a\u000a"The cabinet office also had proposals for broadcasting on mobile phones although we don't know what the procedure is for warning the population as a whole, other than it'll probably be through major national broadcasters.\u000a\u000a"And that's a big problem in terms of believing the message when it appears. If something appears during EastEnders people may think it's a hoax, a spoof or part of normal programming."\u000a\u000aIt is likely that TV broadcasts would be interrupted to display an urgent warning message if the UK ever found itself in the cross hairs.\u000a\u000aDuring the false alarm in Hawaii, football and basketball matches were cut off to play emergency warning messages, all sent by mistake.\u000a\u000aIn the event of a threat to the UK, these TV warnings would probably be supplemented by a radio broadcast urging people to take action.\u000a\u000aBut experts have warned that there are huge risks associated with not telling the public what a legit warning message should look like, and where we could expect to see it crop up.\u000a\u000aProfessor Preston said: "It's really important that people know in advance what these things look like so they can respond to them. Otherwise people do think it's a hoax or won't believe it."\u000a\u000aThe preparedness expert also predicts that social media could play a big role in warning Brits of an impending attack, with news spreading quicker online that it ever could via the radio or TV.\u000a\u000aHe added: "The issue is that if a message were to go out on national television, lots of people use Netflix and other services so may not be watching at that time.\u000a\u000a"In fact, it takes a long time to alert the whole of the population."\u000a\u000aThat's why the government planned to rely on a network of air-raid sirens throughout the Cold War, when the threat of a nuclear attack was at its greatest.\u000a\u000aBut today, the few public sirens we still have are only used for localised risks in ports and industrial centres, rather than to warn of anything like a missile attack.\u000a\u000aBased on the contents of the BBC's Cold War warning message, we have a pretty good idea of what the government would advise in the case of a missile attack.\u000a\u000aThe declassified warning, prepared specifically for a nuclear missile attack, included advice to stay calm and remain indoors, conserving food, batteries and water supplies until it becomes safe to resurface.\u000a\u000aA chilling transcript of the message reads: "This is the Wartime Broadcasting Service. This country has been attacked with nuclear weapons.\u000a\u000a"Water must not be used for flushing lavatories... use your water only for essential drinking and cooking purposes. Water means life. Don't waste it.\u000a\u000a"Do not, in any circumstances, go outside the house. Radioactive fall-out can kill. You cannot see it or feel it, but it is there. If you go outside, you will bring danger to your family and you may die."\u000a\u000aProfessor Preston added that there may be an updated version of this warning which we would hear in the event of an attack.\u000a\u000aThe preparedness researcher said: "The government protocol for any major disaster or emergency is 'Go in, Stay in, Tune in' - and that would be the advice on a missile attack as well. Go inside, stay inside, and tune in to radio or television."\u000a\u000aUnlike almost every other at-risk country, the British government is very secretive about what a real missile attack warning would be like.\u000a\u000aThis would make it hard to know whether a message is a hoax or the real deal in the event of an attack, and could even cost lives.\u000a\u000aProfessor Preston explained: "Other countries have well-developed warning systems which the population knows about. The UK is exceptional really, that we don't have this system.\u000a\u000a"It makes sense to know what the message looks like, but since the end of the Cold War, we've got no idea what the government's plans are to alert us of an incoming missile."\u000a\u000aTo be fair to the government, there are strategic reasons for withholding this crucial info.\u000a\u000aFor one, the government telling everyone out of the blue what to do in the event of a nuclear attack could cause needless panic among Brits.\u000a\u000aEven worse, other countries could take it as a sign that we were preparing to launch an attack on them - and that we are briefing our population in anticipation of a return salvo.\u000a\u000aThis reasoning shows how the North Korea crisis could have escalated over the weekend, if Kim Jong-un had taken the accidental Hawaii alert to mean the Americans were preparing to start a nuclear conflict.\u000a\u000aBut despite this risk, experts now say it's likely that the government will disclose more information about the UK's alert system, in response to heightened global tensions and demands from the public.\u000a\u000aProfessor Preston said: "We are under possible threat in the future of attack from various countries, so the government may revise its plans and actually tell us what would happen."
