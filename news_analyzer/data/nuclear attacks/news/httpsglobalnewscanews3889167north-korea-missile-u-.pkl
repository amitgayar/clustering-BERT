VThe tensions between North Korea and the United States continue to escalate after the rogue nation launched another intercontinental ballistic missile Wednesday.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea claimed the new missile, which appears to be significantly bigger than one tested in July, could also hit any target in the United States.\u000a\u000aREAD MORE: North Korea releases photos of new intercontinental ballistic missile\u000a\u000aAnd after it launched, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis said the missile demonstrated North Korea had the ability to hit \u201ceverywhere in the world.\u201d\u000a\u000aDr. Bruce Blair, former nuclear launch officer and co-founder of Global Zero, said the crisis between the two countries is escalating and \u201cbringing us to the brink of conflict.\u201d\u000a\u000aWATCH: North Korea will be met with \u2018fire and fury\u2019 if they threaten U.S., Trump says\u000a\u000aIt would take only half an hour for a North Korean missile to reach the U.S. And if it was targeted to hit the East Coast, it would surely fly over Canada, Blair said.\u000a\u000aDuring this time, there would be a flurry of activity involving emergency meetings, making sure the president is safe and deciding whether to retaliate.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s what it could look like:\u000a\u000aThe fiery hot plume of the booster would be detected within one minute by U.S. satellites equipped with heat detectors.\u000a\u000aREAD MORE: Where are the 14,935 nuclear weapons in the world?\u000a\u000aThis would spark the early stage of the U.S.\u2019s missile defence and the nuclear retaliation protocols, according to Blair.\u000a\u000aMissile defence units in Alaska and California would be quickly notified. Allied countries, such as South Korea and Japan would also be briefed.\u000a\u000aIn order to detect where the missile is going, two ground radar sites in Alaska would detect and analyze the path.\u000a\u000a\u201cOnce a rocket is launched it goes straight up for awhile so it\u2019s hard to determine its flight path,\u201d Blair said.\u000a\u000aWATCH: North Korea launches ballistic missile powerful enough to reach U.S.\u000a\u000aThe missile defence units would then prepare to launch their interceptors designed to hit the missile in the middle of its trajectory.\u000a\u000aAccording to Blair, the interceptors have a 25 per cent chance of head-on collision with the attacking missile, but most experts believe the true performance to be much lower.\u000a\u000aDuring the same time, an emergency conference would be held with the head of strategic command, the president and his top advisers.\u000a\u000aIf the path of the missile is targeting North America, the president would have a few minutes to decide if retaliation is needed.\u000a\u000aREAD MORE: It would be pretty easy for Donald Trump to launch a nuclear strike, here\u2019s how\u000a\u000aBefore this decision is made, the U.S. military\u2019s alert would be raised two notches to a level known as \u201cDefence Condition Two.\u201d Blair said the only other time this level has been reached was during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\u000a\u000aU.S. forces would then prepare for retaliation and wait for a launch order.\u000a\u000aDuring the emergency conference, two emergency plans would be initiated, according to Blair.\u000a\u000aThe purpose of this plan is to ensure the safety of the president and other key government leaders.\u000a\u000aThis plan has been used once on Sept. 11, 2001, when former U.S. president George W. Bush was whisked away to Air Force bases in Louisiana and Nebraska.\u000a\u000aREAD MORE: Newly released photos of Bush White House show reaction to 9/11 attacks\u000a\u000aIf the president was in the White House during the missile threat, he would only have a few minutes to get to the helicopter and fly to a rendezvous base outside of Washington. The president would then board the doomsday plane, a militarized Boeing 747 possessing all the launch codes and the communications gear needed to send orders directly to the submarines, underground missile crews and bomber crews.\u000a\u000aDuring this plan, the population would be warned of the missile strike by radio and television using a special tone.\u000a\u000aREAD MORE: Canadians are getting more fearful of nuclear war threats, survey finds\u000a\u000aFrom an evacuation site, the president would probably address the nation on available commercial and other channels such as the emergency broadcast network. Bush did this during 9/11.\u000a\u000aThe national guard and other protection and policing functions would be activated.\u000a\u000aWATCH: U.S. says Kim Jong-un \u2018begging for war\u2019 after latest nuclear test
