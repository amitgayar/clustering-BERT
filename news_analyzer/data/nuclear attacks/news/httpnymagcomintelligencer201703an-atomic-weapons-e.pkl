VNot since the 1970s, at the height of the Cold War, have most Americans been jittery about the prospect of a nuclear holocaust. Back then, it seemed like such an immediate possibility that suburban families were constructing fallout shelters and schoolkids were subjected to bomb drills. But after the fall of the Soviet Union, atomic war came to feel like an abstraction, the stuff of sci-fi movies. Then, during the presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton started talking about Trump having \u201caccess to the nuclear codes,\u201d which has turned out to be more than simple campaign fearmongering. As recently as two weeks ago, the 45th president effectively called for a new nuclear-arms race, and he\u2019s also threatened to revoke the nuclear agreement with Iran and to invade North Korea on account of its recent nuclear tests. Of all the threats Trump poses, surely the gravest (if, let\u2019s hope, the most far-fetched) is that he could set off a firefight that would incinerate the globe.\u000a\u000aAtomic-weapons expert Philip Coyle was the head of nuclear-weapons testing under President Bill Clinton and an adviser to the Carter and Obama administrations. And as a scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab in California, he spent 30 years helping design both nuclear arms and the only anti-missile weapon ever deployed by the U.S. Now mostly retired and living in Sacramento, he consults for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, a group that lobbies for arms reduction. In other words, there are few people better equipped to explain just how terrified we should be of global annihilation. Below, he discusses the best way of responding to North Korea, why we should be concerned about India and Pakistan, and his own worst nightmares of our nuclear future.\u000a\u000aIs there anything about nuclear weapons that would keep us up at night if we knew about it?\u000a\u000aWell, for one thing, because I\u2019m old enough, and because of the work I used to do, I\u2019ve actually seen nuclear weapons go off. It\u2019s an amazing, amazingly powerful thing. Once you\u2019ve seen it \u2026 It\u2019s something you don\u2019t ever want to see happen during war.\u000a\u000aI would watch from miles away. If it\u2019s in a place like the Nevada test site, then you\u2019re in a bunker, protected. Or if it\u2019s underground, then you see the ground heave, which is amazing. If it was in the Pacific, you would watch, perhaps, from a Navy ship. I was the director of the largest underground test the United States ever did \u2014 five megatons \u2014 in Alaska. On the web, you can see pictures of the ground rising as the explosion goes off. It just goes up and up and up, and it looks like it\u2019s never going to stop. We begin to get an idea [of what it\u2019s like] in violent storms, tornadoes. Violent landslides. But it\u2019s just not the same.\u000a\u000aWhat do you think of the outlook for the Trump administration\u2019s nuclear policy?\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a little hard to tell. President Trump has said that nuclear weapons are terrible, or awful, something like that. But on the other hand, he told Mika on Morning Joe, \u2018Bring on an arms race!\u2019\u000a\u000aTrump has gone back and forth on whether he supports a \u201cNo First Use\u201d doctrine. Could you explain what this means and the ramifications?\u000a\u000aYes. It means we pledge we will never be the first to use nuclear weapons. If the other side does, we might use them in retaliation, but we would never start a nuclear war. It\u2019s a way of adding security and stability to the peace process. It has always been set by the president. We don\u2019t know yet what President Trump\u2019s view is.\u000a\u000aWhat was the significance of the North Korea nuclear test, the one in January, that Trump responded to from his Mar-a-Lago dinner table?\u000a\u000aNorth Korea has tested nuclear weapons several times now, and while some of the early tests appeared to be fizzles, the more recent tests look like they have actually achieved relatively small nuclear devices. By \u2018small,\u2019 I mean about the size of Hiroshima. They\u2019re not the big thermonuclear weapons of the sort that the United States, Russia, France, and China have. And they don\u2019t have many. And they don\u2019t have many. Congress estimates 10 to 16; other estimates are less than 10\u2014but essentially, a handful. But they\u2019re continuing to test them, and also testing missiles that might carry those weapons. So far, North Korea does not have a missile that can reach the United States, but people worry that given enough time, it could develop one.\u000a\u000aThe significance [of the January test] was that it was about the same size as the previous one, so it appears they can do it twice in a row. And the previous test may \u2014 we don\u2019t know this for sure \u2014 may have helped them make some progress toward making their nuclear device smaller. That is, more easily mounted on a missile of some kind.\u000a\u000aMostly their problem so far has been that their missile tests simply haven\u2019t been intercontinental-range. They\u2019ve been short-to-medium range. So they don\u2019t even have the capability to reach Hawaii, let alone the continental United States. However, they certainly are a threat to South Korea and Japan. They\u2019ve tested missiles with enough range to reach either of those countries.\u000a\u000aThe Wall Street Journal recently reported that the Trump administration is considering military action and regime change in North Korea, among other options, for dealing with the nuclear threat there. What\u2019s your take on that news?\u000a\u000aI think the administration is simply considering the options, and that\u2019s not so surprising. I think every administration looks at the options. Some will be more attractive than others. The main thing North Korea wants is for the United States to stop threatening it. Instead, just last week, the U.S. started military exercises in South Korea.\u000a\u000aIs the nuclear threat at a level that could warrant an action like regime change?\u000a\u000aCertainly it\u2019s a threat that we should be very concerned about. But threatening regime change \u2014 all that does is threaten them even more with the very thing they\u2019re worried about. That\u2019s not going to work. What North Korea wants is for us to stop threatening them and to talk with them, and to sit down and try to reach an agreement, perhaps with the help of other countries: namely, South Korea, Japan, and China. When we\u2019ve done that in the past, it has produced salutary results. North Korea has followed the agreements that we\u2019ve made until we do something to break them.\u000a\u000aFor instance, the Clinton administration had reached an agreement with North Korea, which they were following. The guidelines were not exactly parallel with what has recently happened in Iran, but conceptually they were the same. Then President George W. Bush was elected and immediately began threatening North Korea \u2014 and the deal had been that we wouldn\u2019t do that.\u000a\u000aSo North Korea stopped abiding by the terms as well?\u000a\u000aYes. And that\u2019s the problem with these agreements: They\u2019re very fragile, and it doesn\u2019t take much from either side to trigger an overreaction.\u000a\u000aBesides North Korea, which countries should we be most concerned about?\u000a\u000aThere are also Pakistan and India. People worry that they could get into a regional conflict involving nuclear weapons that would bring in the rest of the world, and all hell would break loose. It could involve large nuclear-weapon states like Russia and China picking sides. Pakistan is estimated to have about 130 nuclear weapons, and India about 120. They tend to match each other. They\u2019ve done exactly the same number of nuclear tests. They keep track and deliberately don\u2019t do more, in order to avoid setting off an imbalance.\u000a\u000aAre there any areas where our fears are overblown?\u000a\u000aI don\u2019t think you can be too concerned, where nuclear weapons are involved, because they\u2019re so destructive.\u000a\u000aYou\u2019ve criticized our nuclear defenses for the way they focus on intercepting \u201climited\u201d attacks. Could you explain what this means and why it\u2019s inadequate?\u000a\u000aThe missile-defense system that we\u2019ve deployed in Alaska and California involves interceptors which would fly out into space and try to hit, head-on, a missile coming from, say, North Korea. The trouble is, that system has done very poorly in flight-intercept tests \u2014 and it\u2019s been getting worse over time, when it ought to be getting better. If you go back over each test since, say, 2000, and look at why it failed, the reasons have varied. A couple failed because the interceptor never got off the ground; a couple failed because the interceptor never separated from its rocket booster.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s one of the most difficult things the Pentagon has ever tried to do. You\u2019re trying to hit an enemy target that\u2019s going 15\u201317,000 miles an hour. You\u2019re going so fast that if you miss by an inch, you can miss by a mile.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, what our development of this intercept system is doing is encouraging other countries to build better offense systems, so that they can overwhelm our missile defenses. Typically in the tests, there\u2019s only one target. You\u2019re trying to shoot down one missile with another missile. There\u2019s no reason why, if Russia were intent on attacking the United States, they would do it that way. They wouldn\u2019t just shoot one missile out of the blue and see what happened \u2014 they would fire large numbers of them.\u000a\u000aRecently Russia tested an intermediate-range missile that could be nuclear \u2014 that could hit Europe, let\u2019s say. If Russia builds a bunch of those, the missile defenses we\u2019re building in Europe right now, in conjunction with NATO will be overwhelmed also. Our system in Europe has interceptors deployed in Romania, and proposed to be deployed, in a year or two, in Poland. Russia hates it because they think it\u2019s aimed at them, and conservative members of Congress say it ought to be aimed at Russia \u2014 just reinforcing what Russia worries about. So Russia\u2019s inclination is to be able to overwhelm that system by building more and more missiles.\u000a\u000aSo it\u2019s a vicious cycle?\u000a\u000aYes, that\u2019s how it works out. If Russia were deploying missile-defense systems in Cuba or Mexico, close to our borders, in the way that Romania and Poland are close to their borders, we wouldn\u2019t like that either. And if the numbers got very large, we\u2019d be just as concerned as Russia is.\u000a\u000aWhat is your worst nightmare of a nuclear disaster?\u000a\u000aI have two. One is that somebody builds or steals a nuclear weapon, overseas somewhere. A military faction, for instance. William Perry, the former secretary of Defense under Clinton, has a video outlining how this could happen.\u000a\u000aThe other is that the United States and Russia will get into another nuclear-arms race and create a much more dangerous world than we\u2019ve had heretofore. You see this in Congress, where various members are calling for new nuclear capabilities on the part of the United States \u2014 which, obviously, Russia and China would feel they had to respond to. You see it also in a recent Defense Science Board report, where they recommend low-yield nuclear weapons as a way of deterring Russia \u2014 the idea being that, because they\u2019re low-yield, it\u2019s more believable that we would actually use them. But, of course, if the idea is to make them more usable, that makes them more dangerous \u2014 because they might actually get used!\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a new bill Congress is working on called the Intermediate-Range Forces Treaty Preservation Act. It\u2019s ironic that they call it that. It would be more accurate to call it the Violation Act, because the things it recommends would all be violations of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty [a 1987 agreement that the U.S. and Russia would eliminate all their ground-launched missiles with a certain range capacity]. It hasn\u2019t been voted on or anything, so maybe it will never happen. But for example, they\u2019re calling for a dual program of a dual-capable \u2014 meaning they could be nuclear or nonnuclear \u2014 road-mobile missile-launch system, with ranges between 500 kilometers and, say, 6,000 kilometers. Obviously, if the United States did something like that, Russia and China would feel very concerned and feel they had to respond.\u000a\u000aSo this kind of sword-rattling could ultimately make the world a much more dangerous place.\u000a\u000aBy and large, Americans aren\u2019t viscerally afraid of nuclear war in the way they were in the 1950s and \u201960s. But how close are we actually to the threat of a nuclear holocaust, compared to the situation during the Cold War?\u000a\u000aUntil very recently, I would have said that we were moving farther and farther away from nuclear war, because the U.S. and Russian stockpiles have been going down, and because other countries that have nuclear weapons have been restrained. They could have built many more than they have so far. And because of this general attitude that nuclear weapons are simply not acceptable anymore, as a moral matter, and that no sane U.S. president would ever use them. But more recently, with the sword-rattling we are talking about, I\u2019ve become more concerned.\u000a\u000aYou mean since the last campaign cycle began?\u000a\u000aExactly.
