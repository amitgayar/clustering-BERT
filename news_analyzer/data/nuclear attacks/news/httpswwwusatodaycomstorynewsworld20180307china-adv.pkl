VYANJI, China \u2014 The Chinese government has offered advice to its citizens along the border with North Korea in case of a nuclear attack: duck and run for cover.\u000a\u000aPeople in this frontier town fear they could be caught in the middle of a nuclear standoff between the United States and North Korea if Pyongyang were to step up its nuclear and missile tests that could reach the U.S. mainland.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump on Thursday agreed to a high-stakes meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\u000a\u000aMore: What you need to know about potential U.S.-North Korea talks\u000a\u000aMore: U.S.: North Korea used chemical agent VX to kill Kim Jong Un's half-brother\u000a\u000aThe move toward talks comes after a war of words between North Korea and Trump ratcheted up for months, making the prospect of nuclear Armageddon appear imminent. Adding to the tension was pressure put on China from the United States and others to rein in its belligerent North Korea ally.\u000a\u000aThe concern ran so high that China's ruling Communist Party made the rare moveto hammer home the risks of a nuclear war \u2014 and how to possibly survive. The state-owned newspaper here ran a full page of advice that included illustrations resembling comic strips to help get the message across.\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t look toward the blast. And move quick \u2014 in two seconds look for a physical barrier to hide behind,\u201d the newspaper warned in December. \u201cJump into a river or a lake and dive under the water.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat last recommendation could be difficult because waterways are frozen most of the winter in this frigid corner of northeastern China. In Yanji and surrounding Jilin province, North Korean defectors have walked across the frozen river to reach Chinese soil. Authorities routinely send them back.\u000a\u000aChe Yong, a 6-foot-1 native here, shudders at the thought of ducking for cover in a nuclear attack.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve been living with this threat even when I was still in college,\u201d said Che, 27, now a doctoral student in Korean literature. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just been getting worse. Where am I going to hide when the Big One finally hits?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Chinese here fear they could become collateral damage as North Korea threatened to target the U.S. and its territories, including Guam.\u000a\u000aThe North's nearest underground test site is less than 70 miles away, and residents already were rattled by the tremors from nuclear tests. A 2016 test blast left a 2-foot-long split in the high school athletic field near downtown. People discuss on social media their fears that a nuclear test or blast could trigger an eruption from the active  volcano on the boarder.\u000a\u000aMore: Trump: 'We'll see what happens' with possible North Korea talks\u000a\u000aMore: 'The world is watching': North Korea reportedly would consider abandoning nukes program\u000a\u000a\u201cI can feel the earth shake beneath my feet. You bet I\u2019m scared, but what can I do?\u201d said Wang Li, a university bookstore clerk looking after her nephew at the store. \u201cI can\u2019t leave this town. All my family is here.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnticipating that local residents like Wang and her family would have to flee after a nuclear strike, the Chinese government is building several \u201crefugee settlement sites\u201d along the border that could house a half-million people, according to The Nikkei newspaper in Japan, citing documents obtained from China Mobile, the country\u2019s largest phone service provider.\u000a\u000aRobert Jacobs, a historian of nuclear technologies at Hiroshima City University, said China\u2019s duck-and-roll survival guide is largely futile. He said authorities are ill-prepared for the aftereffects of a nuclear blast.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor people living across the border, the real problem for them is radioactive fallout and what comes after,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cThe (newspaper) advisory is public relations management. They tell people things to make them feel good.\u201d\u000a\u000aChe, born to one of the many ethnic Koreans who have lived in this region for generations, taps outside sources to stay informed about a possible nuclear threat. He knows that China's state-censored media often ignore news developments as a way to maintain order.\u000a\u000a\u201cMost Koreans in the area tune into South Korea TV channels for news, so we have better access to facts,\u201d Che said. \u201cNorth Korea is a huge threat to our security."
