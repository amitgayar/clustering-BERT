VAt 11:24 pm Eastern time on Sunday, President Donald Trump sent an all-caps tweet threatening war with the Islamic Republic of Iran.\u000a\u000aTrump had apparently heard part of a recent speech by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in which Rouhani warned that a US-Iran confrontation would be \u201cthe mother of all wars.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe American president interpreted this as a threat and sent an extremely scary tweet in response.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s important not to dismiss this as empty Trump rhetoric: War with Iran is an idea that has a lot of support among conservatives and members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet. Both Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton publicly called for airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities prior to joining the Trump administration.\u000a\u000aWith the 2015 Iran deal on the ropes after Trump\u2019s withdrawal, the potential for Iran to restart prohibited nuclear activities has never been greater \u2014 and no one is really sure how Trump will respond if that happens.\u000a\u000aWhat this means is that, as scary as it sounds, we have to take the possibility of war with Iran seriously. We need to understand just what such a war would entail and what the consequences would be if it happened.\u000a\u000aThe best estimates we have suggest it would be a disaster.\u000a\u000aSurgical strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities would only set back the program temporarily, but destroying the country\u2019s nuclear capacity entirely would require a massive military effort. That would kill thousands of people, destroy whatever vestiges of political stability remain in the Middle East, and potentially wreak havoc on the global economy \u2014 all while likely failing to permanently end Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions.\u000a\u000aGiven that the Iran deal has, so far, successfully rolled back the nuclear program, it\u2019s hard to see why this would be worth it. But here we are.\u000a\u000aGenerally, advocates of military action against Iran propose a limited air campaign targeting the heart of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. \u201cAn attack need not destroy all of Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure,\u201d Bolton wrote in a 2015 New York Times op-ed. \u201cBy breaking key links in the nuclear-fuel cycle, it could set back its program.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe key targets in such proposals are the nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Arak (the uranium conversion facility at Isfahan is also often referenced). Activity at these facilities has been slowed or suspended entirely under the nuclear deal, but the buildings have not been demolished. If Iran were to restart its push toward a bomb, then those would be the places it would start \u2014 and thus would be the first target in any US attack.\u000a\u000aSome of these, Fordow in particular, are fortified, but the US has bunker-buster bombs that are capable of doing real damage to them. But even such \u201climited\u201d strikes would be a massive military operation.\u000a\u000aThe first issue is that the US would need to destroy Iran\u2019s air defenses, including fighters and surface-to-air missiles, in order to ensure the bombs hit their targets and to prevent Iran from doing serious damage in response. According to Robert Farley, a professor at the University of Kentucky and an expert on air power, this \u201cwould involve long-range bombers, drones, electronic warfare, land-based fighter-bombers, carrier aircraft, and submarine-launched cruise missiles.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven the strikes against the nuclear program would need to hit a broad range of targets. Contrary to the assumptions of Iran hawks, the strikes couldn\u2019t be limited to Iran\u2019s big nuclear production facilities. The real problem, according to a RAND Corporation brief by Robert J. Reardon, would be Iran\u2019s centrifuge production facilities. Simply destroying Iranian enrichment plants would not be enough to end the nuclear weapons program if Iran could just build centrifuges for new ones quickly. It\u2019s not actually clear how many such facilities there are.\u000a\u000a\u201cSites that have been identified, or ones that were known in the past, have typically been small, easily concealed from reconnaissance satellites, and located in densely populated urban areas,\u201d Reardon writes. \u201cFailure to destroy these sites would allow the Iranians to rebuild their enrichment program, because the machines could be manufactured relatively quickly.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf the first round of strikes didn\u2019t destroy every target, the US might need to return again and again. It would require the US to \u201ccontinue a sustained campaign over a period of time and re-strike after an initial battle damage assessment [if] it is found that further strike sorties are required,\u201d defense analysts Anthony Cordesman and Abdullah Toukan write in a comprehensive 2012 Center for Strategic and International Studies report.\u000a\u000aAnd even that probably wouldn\u2019t demolish the program. \u201cDepending on the forces allocated and duration of air strikes, it is unlikely that an air campaign alone could ... terminate Iran\u2019s program,\u201d Cordesman and Toukan argue.\u000a\u000aThey\u2019re not the only ones who have come to this conclusion. A panel at the nonpartisan Wilson Center reviewed the military studies on the issue and concluded that even if extended military strikes were carried out \u201cto near perfection,\u201d the best-case scenario is still only a four-year delay in Iran\u2019s progress toward a nuclear weapon.\u000a\u000aUltimately, the only way military force could stop Iran from going nuclear is if the US committed to a more or less indefinite war.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo fulfill the stated objective of ensuring that Iran never acquires a nuclear bomb,\u201d the Wilson Center report finds, \u201cthe U.S. would need to conduct a significantly expanded air and sea war over a prolonged period of time, likely several years.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe consequences of such a prolonged war, especially in today\u2019s Middle East, would be disastrous. Iran has the power to make an unstable Middle East even worse: It could directly target and kill Americans in the region, exacerbate a number of the region\u2019s festering conflicts, and potentially threaten the global oil supply \u2014 and thus the global economy.\u000a\u000aIranian proxy militias could also decide to attack American troops in Iraq if talks fall apart. While the US is particularly exposed in Iraq, it has people and assets across much of the region; Iran, too, has proxies across the Middle East. It\u2019s difficult to imagine Iran staying its hand in the event of an outright US attack.\u000a\u000aIran could also attack oil infrastructure or blockade the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil shipping route, all of which would have tremendous effects.\u000a\u000a\u201dIran can use a mix of mines, submarines, submersibles, drones, anti\u2010ship missiles, small craft, and assault forces anywhere in the Gulf region to threaten the flow of oil exports,\u201d Cordesman and Toukan write. \u201cAny major disruption affects the entire economy of Asia and all world oil prices \u2014 regardless of where oil is produced. It can lead to panic and hoarding on a global basis.\u201d\u000a\u000aAirstrikes would destroy what has been a key constraint on Iran\u2019s nuclear program: the system of international inspections and sanctions that brought Iran to the negotiating table in the first place.\u000a\u000aEuropean and Asian countries have given the US strategy much of its force by helping to isolate and sanction Iran; that is what compelled Iran to negotiate and agree to make concessions in the first place. These countries are already angry at Trump for withdrawing from the deal, and seem totally uninterested in reimposing sanctions to try to get \u201ca better deal.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf the US attacked Iran, the international community would likely be appalled and abandon its support for sanctioning and isolating Iran altogether, leaving the country wealthier and in a stronger diplomatic position.\u000a\u000aThat would, in turn, cripple any serious attempt to prevent Iran from rebuilding its nuclear program.\u000a\u000a\u201dIn the absence of clear evidence that Iran was dashing for a bomb,\u201d Georgetown University\u2019s Colin Kahl told Congress in 2012, \u201ca US strike risks shattering international consensus, making postwar containment more difficult to implement. And with inspectors gone, it would be much harder to detect and prevent Iran\u2019s clandestine rebuilding efforts.\u201d\u000a\u000aStriking Iran, then, wouldn\u2019t be a \u201cseveral-day\u201d endeavor, as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), a congressional uberhawk who reportedly has Trump\u2019s ear on national security issues, once suggested. It wouldn\u2019t stop Iran\u2019s nuclear program unless the United States committed to more or less permanent war with Iran \u2014 and may not work even then. And it would likely have devastating consequences for the US and its allies.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s ironic here is that the nuclear deal is working reasonably well to constrain Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the organization tasked with implementing the deal, has repeatedly certified that Iran is in compliance with its terms. Given the deal\u2019s strict inspection provisions, it would be very hard for Iran to bamboozle International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors \u2014 meaning that so long as it is in place, there\u2019s very little risk that Iran becomes a North Korea-style nuclear threat anytime soon.\u000a\u000aSo far, the deal is holding even after US withdrawal. But Iran\u2019s compliance is tenuous, and further belligerence from the US could give Tehran a reason to stop abiding by the deal\u2019s limitations.\u000a\u000aThe logic of threatening a painful, pointless war under these circumstances escapes me. But the president of the United States, and several of his top national security advisers, seems to disagree.
