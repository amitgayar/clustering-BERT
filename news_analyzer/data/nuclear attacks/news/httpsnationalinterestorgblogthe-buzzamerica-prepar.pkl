VThe NPR outlines a new \u201ctailored deterrence\u201d policy that seeks to persuade Chinese leaders to avoid miscalculations\u2014but it could lead to war.\u000a\u000aRussia\u2019s leader Vladimir Putin unveiled several new nuclear weapons last week in a replay of the Cold War. China, meanwhile, is continuing a similar buildup of high-technology strategic nuclear forces that remains largely hidden from view.\u000a\u000aChinese secrecy about its nuclear forces and their use was a major theme of the Pentagon\u2019s recently completed Nuclear Posture Review that outlined a new \u201ctailored deterrence\u201d policy for China.\u000a\u000aThe new plan is aimed at persuading Chinese leaders to avoid military miscalculations \u2013 like provocative actions in the South China Sea, or hostile activities related to Taiwan or Japan \u2013 that could quickly escalate into a nuclear exchange.\u000a\u000aThe unclassified posture review shed little light on the details of the buildup of China\u2019s nuclear forces other than identifying what were called \u201centirely new nuclear capabilities.\u201d They include several new types of missiles, including hypersonic weapons, satellite-killing missiles and regional intermediate-range nuclear forces.\u000a\u000aThe review takes note of the main threat of a nuclear war between the United States and China: A military encounter that escalates into a regional conflict culminating in a nuclear exchange involving China\u2019s regional nuclear-armed missiles.\u000a\u000aRecommended: America Has Military Options for North Korea (but They're All Bad)\u000a\u000aRecommended: 1,700 Planes Ready for War: Everything You Need To Know About China's Air Force\u000a\u000a\u201cOur tailored strategy for China is designed to prevent Beijing from mistakenly concluding that it could secure an advantage through the limited use of its theater nuclear capabilities, or that any use of nuclear weapons, however limited, is acceptable,\u201d the review states.\u000a\u000aThe Pentagon did not specify how tailored deterrence would work. It warned that the United States \u201cwill maintain the capability to credibly threaten intolerable damage as Chinese leaders calculate costs and benefits, such that the costs incurred as a result of Chinese nuclear employment, at any level of escalation, would vastly outweigh any benefit.\u201d\u000a\u000aStrategic military planning for China, however, would likely seek to put at risk what Chinese leaders hold most dearly: Continued rule by the Communist Party of China. Thus, U.S. tailored deterrence would involve signaling to the Chinese leadership that any future conflict would result in the destruction of the Chinese Communist Party, and its military arm, the People\u2019s Liberation Army.\u000a\u000aChinese leadership statements and military writings make clear China probably understands that strategy, and the military has invested heavily in defending Party leaders.\u000a\u000aThe PLA has built robust leadership security systems that include networks of underground escape and transit systems to be used by senior Party leaders in a crisis or conflict.\u000a\u000aFor example, the Zhongnanhai leadership compound in Beijing, where Party leaders live and work, includes a terminal for a large underground tunnel and rail system that runs to a major command center west of the city known as the Western Hills. From that command center, other underground trains and tunnels lead to additional secure facilities in various parts of the country.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately for the Chinese, U.S. intelligence agencies have known the locations of many of these leadership protection facilities. And the Pentagon has been developing precision-guided bombs and missiles capable of penetrating the underground bunkers and tunnels \u2013 putting China\u2019s most valuable strategic assets at risk.\u000a\u000aOne problem for the United States has been China\u2019s repeated refusal to engage in official discussions that could make such deterrence goals clear.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have long sought a dialogue with China to enhance our understanding of our respective nuclear policies, doctrine, and capabilities; to improve transparency; and to help manage the risks of miscalculation and misperception,\u201d the review says. \u201cWe hope that China will share this interest and that meaningful dialogue can commence.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe reason China does not hold such talks is the Chinese view that any discussion of its strategic nuclear and non-nuclear capabilities \u2013 such as nuclear forces, space weapons and cyber-attack capabilities \u2013 as undermining deterrence.\u000a\u000aThat was disclosed several years ago in a classified State Department cable outlining a June 2008 meeting in Beijing. During the talks, U.S. officials called on China to be more open about its nuclear capabilities.\u000a\u000aIn response, China\u2019s then-Assistant Foreign Minister He Yafei responded that China\u2019s nuclear forces were a \u201csensitive issue\u201d and officials engaged in the talks did not even know the size of China\u2019s nuclear arsenal. \u201cNow is not the time for China to tell others what we have,\u201d He Yafei said, adding that even revealing the size of the nuclear arsenal would \u201celiminate its deterrent value.\u201d\u000a\u000aThus, excessive secrecy remains a hallmark of China\u2019s approach to deterrence. By keeping its nuclear and non-nuclear military power secret, China calculates the United States will not risk a conflict without fully knowing what kind of weapons will be used.\u000a\u000aThe Pentagon\u2019s new posture review, however, appears to be taking the Chinese strategic secrecy into account.\u000a\u000aBecause China is developing new and formidable capabilities to threaten U.S. interests and those of allies and partners, the Pentagon is expanding the conditions for using nuclear forces in response to non-nuclear attacks, such as the destruction of satellites or devastating cyber attacks on power grids.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe United States is prepared to respond decisively to Chinese non-nuclear or nuclear aggression,\u201d the review says.\u000a\u000aWhile continuing to seek \u201cmeaningful dialogue\u201d with China, the United States will use military exercises that demonstrate nuclear strike capabilities, and, second, will increase the range of \u201cgraduated nuclear response options available to the president,\u201d the review said.\u000a\u000aChina\u2019s Defense Ministry reacted to the nuclear review with harsh criticism. Spokesman Ren Guoqiang, repeating standard Beijing propaganda, saying the review\u2019s view of China as a threat was a reflection of American anti-communism.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe hope the US side will discard its \u2018cold-war mentality,\u2019 shoulder its own special and primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament, understand correctly China\u2019s strategic intentions and take a fair view on China\u2019s national defense and military development,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aAmerican defense officials say the secret version of posture review includes details on the weapons of concern, including the growing arsenal of land-based missiles of various types and ranges, and the addition of multiple warheads that are both independently targetable and maneuverable.\u000a\u000aThe secret review also addresses the numerous unknowns about China\u2019s nuclear modernization program, such as total warheads in the stockpile, their location in the 3,000-mile long underground tunnel network known as the Great Underground War, and uncertainties about the chain of command and decision-making for using nuclear arms.\u000a\u000aMost American intelligence analysts and military planners doubt the official Chinese declaratory policy of not being the first nation to use nuclear weapons in a conflict.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile China\u2019s declaratory policy and doctrine have not changed, its lack of transparency regarding the scope and scale of its nuclear modernization program raises questions regarding its future intent,\u201d the review states.\u000a\u000aAll signs related to the Chinese nuclear buildup, especially the increase in both numbers and capabilities for short- and medium-range nuclear missiles, suggest Beijing is preparing to use its nuclear arsenal during the early phases of a conflict and not after a nuclear strike on China.\u000a\u000aLike the United States, China appears to be planning to blend nuclear and conventional military power in tandem.\u000a\u000aThus, nuclear explosions in space designed to knock out U.S. intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and command and control systems could be a first use of nuclear arms early in a conflict.\u000a\u000aOnce satellites have been disabled, China\u2019s formidable cyber forces would go to work attacking critical infrastructure, including attacks on the U.S. electric grid.\u000a\u000aThe review also accuses China of exploiting American nuclear weapons restraint, which took place during the administration of President Barack Obama when nuclear weapons were downgraded in U.S. defense strategy. While the US reduced nuclear arms, China and Russia both \u201cmoved in the opposite direction,\u201d the review states.\u000a\u000aThe nuclear buildup is a central part of what Chinese supreme leader Xi Jinping has announced the PLA will fully modernize by 2050. The weapons include a new road-mobile strategic intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), a new multi-warhead version of its DF-5 silo-based ICBM, and its most advanced ballistic missile submarine armed with new submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM).\u000a\u000aA new bomber is also planned that would provide Beijing with a complete nuclear triad.\u000a\u000aThe intermediate-range DF-26, a missile with precision guidance, is also one of the major strategic nuclear missiles that can strike both land and naval targets.
