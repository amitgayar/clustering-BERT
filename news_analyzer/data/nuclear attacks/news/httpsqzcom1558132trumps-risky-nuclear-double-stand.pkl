VA confidential UN report highlights North Korea\u2019s global distribution of missile technology and chemicals weapons, including through a Syrian arms dealer and in the civil war in Yemen, according to Foreign Policy.\u000a\u000aWhy does it matter? This is exactly the kind of activity by Iran that last year led US president Donald Trump to unilaterally pull out of a global non-proliferation agreement with Tehran, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) or simply the Iran nuclear deal.\u000a\u000aUS intelligence officials insisted that all their evidence showed Iran abiding by the JCPOA. But Iran continues to back terrorist groups and funnel money and resources into various proxy wars in the Middle East, and continues to develop ballistic missiles it says are limited to a range of 2,000 km (1,243 miles). With a dubiously binding annex of the JCPOA calling on Iran not to develop missiles at all, the US used it as proxy to pull out.\u000a\u000aYet in a matter of days, Trump will sit down for a second time with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un in Vietnam to talk about ending the latter\u2019s pursuit of nuclear armaments while proclaiming they have a \u201cgreat relationship.\u201d But North Korea, as the UN document but also years of reporting and intelligence work confirm, is just as busy destabilizing the world.\u000a\u000aConsider that North Korea continues to contribute technology and expertise to the very Iranian missile program that so upsets US officials. North Korea helped Syria develop the chemical weapons (paywall) used by Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad. The regime\u2019s security forces were behind the brazen assassination of Kim\u2019s brother, Kim Jong-nam, in a Malaysian airport in 2017.  And more than Iran, North Korea is suspected in costly cyber attacks, like a digital heist of Bangladesh\u2019s central bank in 2016 or the attacks on Sony in 2014.\u000a\u000aBut on Feb. 13, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CBS News that \u201cNorth Korea behaves very differently. They\u2019re not destabilizing Yemen. They\u2019re not destabilizing Syria. They\u2019re not conducting enormous assassination campaigns. These countries\u2019 behaviors are different.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s hard to say that\u2019s truly the case. Arguably, Iran is closer to being a democracy and a rule-abiding member of the international order than North Korea. But the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy apparently sees North Korea as worthy of honey, while Iran gets the stick.\u000a\u000aPart of the story may simply be Trump\u2019s desire to reverse the work of the Obama administration, which inked the JCPOA with Iran but failed to achieve a diplomatic opening with North Korea. Now, Trump is bellicose toward Tehran and beatific toward Pyongyang. Trump and his staff also believe that the religion Islam is a unique threat to the United States, which colors their analysis.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s also difficult to extract US posture towards Iran from regional power politics. In the Middle East, the administration values its relationships with Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf States, all Iranian rivals, more than it does a consistent approach to nonproliferation or human rights. But in Asia, South Korea and China favor a diplomatic approach to North Korea, while Japan has taken a back seat in recent talks.\u000a\u000aThe problem with this inconsistent approach is that these talks are not taking place in a vacuum. Potential nuclear states keeping a wary eye on the US may deduce that their only protection is to develop nuclear weapons as fast as possible: Nuclear-armed Kim Jong Un is feted by the US while mere aspirants like the Ayatollah are sanctioned, and those without nuclear weapons\u2014Libya\u2019s Muammar Gaddafi and Iraq\u2019s Saddam Hussein\u2014are dead.\u000a\u000aThis is not an incentive that arms control experts think is helpful. And given the lack of any framework for a deal prepared before the summit\u2014recall the years of complex negotiations that led to the JCPOA\u2014few are expecting a concrete denuclearization deal to emerge from next week\u2019s meeting between the two leaders. Given the danger of North Korea, they just hope it won\u2019t get any worse.
