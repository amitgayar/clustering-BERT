VIt\u2019s a topic that\u2019s been given little thought since the Cold War ended more than 25 years ago. But last month, a dozen Members of Parliament gathered in Ottawa to discuss a newly pressing question: How prepared is Canada for nuclear war?\u000a\u000aOf primary concern is the escalating tension between North Korea and the United States. In an interview with The New York Times published Sunday, Republican Senator Bob Corker said he fears Trump is putting America \u201con the path to World War III.\u201d The Nobel Committee signalled its concern last week by awarding its Peace Prize to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. \u201cWe live in a world where the risk of nuclear weapons being used is greater than it has been for a long time,\u201d committee chair Berit Reiss-Andersen said. And that message was echoed at a conference of international experts this week in Paris, where former British prime minister Tony Blair warned of the \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d if Trump were to order an attack on North Korea.\u000a\u000aCanada, which has no nuclear weapons, is generally an afterthought in these conversations, but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no cause for alarm. Over the four-hour briefing last month by experts from the government, the military and academia, the MPs on the Standing Committee on National Defence heard a simple but sober message: It is \u201conly a matter of time\u201d before North Korea develops a nuclear-armed ballistic missile capable of reaching North America, said Stephen Burt, assistant chief of defence intelligence. And Canada would be essentially defenceless should such a missile be launched.\u000a\u000aOr as James Fergusson, director of the University of Manitoba\u2019s Centre for Defence and Security Studies, testified in front of the Standing Committee, \u201cWe get on our knees and pray.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe and other experts agree that the kind of global war of total annihilation feared during the 1980s is now unlikely. But a nuclear exchange would nonetheless be devastating. The Nukemap, an online tool created by science historian Alex Wellerstein, shows the projected impact of nuclear warheads on different cities. It forecasts that 728,000 people would be killed if a 150-kiloton bomb \u2014 believed to be the size of the one tested by North Korea in August \u2014 were detonated above New York City. Detonated over downtown Vancouver, the same bomb would kill an estimated 98,000 people.\u000a\u000aHow likely a Canadian city would be targeted is debatable. John Clearwater, a military analyst and author of Canadian Nuclear Weapons: The Untold Story of Canada\u2019s Cold War Arsenal, said North Korea would not want to waste one of its few warheads on Canada when its true enemy lies to the south. And even though an intercontinental ballistic missile would need to pass over Canada to reach a target in the central or eastern U.S., he doesn\u2019t see much risk of it falling short.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf it attained necessary altitude and angles to be a true ICBM launch, it\u2019s not likely that 20 minutes into its 26-minute flight it\u2019s going to accidentally fall out of space and hit Canada,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aFergusson, however, told the House of Commons committee it\u2019s unclear how well North Korea has mastered missile guidance systems \u2014 meaning a misfire is possible. Canada could also be what he called a \u201cdemonstration target.\u201d A North Korean regime on the verge of defeat in a conventional war might \u201clook at Canada and say, \u2018We can fire at Canada, undefended, along a path which would demonstrate our ability to hit Washington D.C.,\u2019\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aIf North Korea did fire an ICBM toward North America, one of the first Canadians to know would be Lt.-Gen. Pierre St-Amand, deputy commander of the North American Aerospace Defence Command.\u000a\u000aBut as he told MPs, while Canadians work alongside Americans to detect missiles at NORAD headquarters in Colorado Springs, they are not part of decisions on whether to shoot down an incoming missile. That\u2019s because in 2005, under then prime minister Paul Martin, Canada declined to participate in the U.S. ballistic missile defence system developed to deal with the threat posed to North America by rogue nuclear-armed states.\u000a\u000aAnd St-Amand said the assumption that America would try to shoot down any missile, whether it was headed for Houston or Ottawa, is misguided. \u201cWe\u2019re being told in Colorado Springs that the extant U.S. policy is not to defend Canada,\u201d he said. In the \u201cheat of the moment,\u201d the U.S. command could go contrary to the policy, but \u201cit would be entirely a U.S. discussion and a U.S. decision,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMichael Byers, a University of British Columbia political science professor who also testified in Ottawa, disagrees. \u201cThe U.S. isn\u2019t going to take the chance of radioactive drift coming across from Vancouver or Toronto,\u201d he said. \u201cAny missile coming towards North America would be targeted by the Americans. We don\u2019t need to be part of U.S. missile defence for that to happen.\u201d He did caution, however, that there is no guarantee that, even in the \u201cimplausible\u201d event that Canada is targeted, the missile defence system would work.\u000a\u000aShould a North Korean nuclear warhead evade missile defences and strike a North American city, experts in disaster preparedness fear we are not ready. Dennis Mileti, former director of the National Hazards Center at University of Colorado, said he sees no signs that authorities are educating citizens about what to do after a nuclear detonation. More was done in the 1950s and \u201960s when the chances of surviving an all-out nuclear war were slim and the recommended protection was laughable.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe trained children in schools to get under their desks and cover the backs of their necks to protect themselves from shattered glass, which does absolutely nothing to protect them from radiation,\u201d Mileti said. Since then, a lot has been learned about how people can shield themselves from the effects of radiation. But once a nuclear detonation has gone off, \u201call electronic communications would be out,\u201d he said. \u201cA public education campaign should be going on now.\u201d\u000a\u000aIrwin Redlener, a public health professor at Columbia University, has been trying to get the message out for years. In a 2008 TED Talk addressing the risk of terrorists detonating a small nuclear bomb, he complained that not a single American city has effective plans to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster.\u000a\u000a\u201cPart of the problem is that the emergency planners themselves, personally, are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe. They are paralyzed,\u201d he said in 2008. \u201cYou say \u2018nuclear\u2019 to them, and they\u2019re thinking, \u2018Oh my God, we\u2019re all gone. What\u2019s the point? It\u2019s futile.\u2019 And we\u2019re trying to tell them, \u2018It\u2019s not futile. We can change the survival rates by doing some commonsensical things.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aNine years later, the paralysis is still there, but Redlener has not given up. He even appeared on the Jimmy Kimmel show last month. His message is straightforward: A nuclear explosion would create a blast wave and thermal pulse that would kill everyone in the immediate vicinity within seconds \u2014 for that 150-kiloton warhead, a radius of several kilometres. Beyond the blast zone, the biggest risk would be the radioactive dust and debris that would fall to the ground soon after the explosion. There would be no time to outrun that (at most, people would have a 10- to 15-minute warning) so people would need shelter, ideally either underground or on the middle floors of a tall building, away from windows.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou want as much distance and as much shielding as possible between you and the detonation, and you stay in this shelter environment for somewhere between 24 and 72 hours.\u201d\u000a\u000aAli Asgary, associate professor of Disaster & Emergency Management at York University in Toronto, adds that in the immediate aftermath of a detonation, people would be left to fend for themselves. When authorities advise the public to have survival kits on hand, he said, they are thinking of earthquakes and tornadoes but also nuclear disaster.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou should not expect government emergency responders to reach you, even before two weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would be exposed to radiation that might affect them. It is better even for emergency responders to wait for a few days sometimes so that radiation level goes down and they can go to help.\u201d\u000a\u000aDuring the Cold War, the Canadian government ran public education campaigns promoting civil defence and built a network of bunkers to house key government members in the event of a nuclear attack. But the largest, the \u201cDiefenbunker\u201d outside Ottawa, was decommissioned in 1994 and turned into a museum. Today, Canada has no specific public plan to respond to a nuclear missile attack. When asked, a spokesman for Public Safety Canada referred to the Federal Nuclear Emergency Plan \u2014 a Health Canada initiative designed to respond to a peacetime accident involving a nuclear power plant \u2014 and the 2011 Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosives Resilience Strategy, which is essentially a plan to come up with a plan to deal with a catastrophic terror attack.\u000a\u000aIf a missile hit, the extent of the dangerous fallout would depend on the size of the blast. A 2011 study by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security looked at a scenario where a terrorist detonated a 10-kiloton nuclear bomb and found that high levels of radiation causing illness or death would extend up to 30 kilometres downwind.\u000a\u000aWind speed can also affect the spread of fallout, visible as sandlike grains, so although potentially fatal radiation drops off rapidly, protective measures could be required hundreds of kilometres away from the target of a bomb. A 2010 U.S. Government guide for response to a 10-kiloton nuclear detonation, for example, said fallout could \u201chave a low-level continental impact.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven if nuclear war occurred primarily in Asia \u2014 if Trump \u201ctotally destroyed\u201d North Korea, as he has threatened \u2014 radiation would drift to North America with possible long-term health effects, said Redlener.\u000a\u000aWherever a bomb hit, and however far radioactivity spread, the psychological fallout would be far-reaching. \u201cJust imagining this kind of incident is already impacting the general public (by causing anxiety.),\u201d said Asgary. \u201cThe closer you are, the more connection you have with the country, the higher the impacts.\u201d\u000a\u000aDisruption could also last generations, according to Redlener. After natural disasters like the recent hurricanes that hit the U.S., the focus is on how quickly life can get back to normal. But after a nuclear attack normal might never return.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe would have essentially permanent loss of real estate that will not be habitable for people\u2019s lifetimes and more,\u201d he said. He also believes there would be economic reverberations \u201cnot just locally in the communities affected but regionally, nationally and internationally.\u201d\u000a\u000aPredictions beyond that enters the realm of science fiction, he said, but he does imagine any nuclear attack as a moral turning point, whether the United States struck pre-emptively or was forced to confront an attack on its soil or an ally\u2019s.\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope we\u2019re never in that position where we have to choose between not responding to an actual nuclear attack or wiping out another country, which consists of 99.9999 % of people who just want to get up in the morning and have some semblance of normalcy.\u201d
