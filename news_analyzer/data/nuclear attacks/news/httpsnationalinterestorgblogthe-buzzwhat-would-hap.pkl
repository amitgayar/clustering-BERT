VDozens upon dozens of missiles take flight.\u000a\u000aFor years, the world had heard warnings, but most doubted the day would ever come. Most fall before allied defenses, but one missile finds its mark \u2014 it\u2019s the one that matters most. In a flash, hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people perish.\u000a\u000aWould North Korea fire off a nuclear weapon? No one knows for certain, but what we do know is that the above scenario is exactly what an aggressive and increasingly-powerful North Korea has been threatening for decades. While the reclusive regime may have previously lacked the necessary weaponry, the North now has the kind of capabilities to turn at least some of its threats into promises.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. and its East Asian allies have strategic defense assets in position, but war is full of uncertainties. \u201cPeople think missile defenses are a magic wand. They aren\u2019t,\u201d Jeffrey Lewis, a renowned arms expert, told The Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF).\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s what happens if the North pulls the trigger.\u000a\u000aWhat Would Happen If A Launch Appeared Imminent?\u000a\u000aThe U.S. and its allies in the region are by no means unprepared for a North Korean nuclear attack.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. and South Korea both have preemptive strike plans for a situation in which a North Korean nuclear attack appears imminent, and while Japan is considering new options, it still relies heavily on U.S. defense.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea has a three-stage defense system, the first stage of which is a preemptive strike option designed to eliminate the North\u2019s offensive capabilities. The \u201cKill Chain\u201d preemptive strike system detects signs of an impending nuclear missile launch and strikes the North\u2019s nuclear weapons sites and missile bases with cruise missiles and other weaponry.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. and South Korea also have a joint response plan, Operations Plan (OPLAN) 5015.\u000a\u000aWhile the specifics for OPLAN 5015 are classified, the plan is believed to consolidate previous contingency plans, specifically OPLAN 5029 (internal instability in North Korea), OPLAN 5027 (preparations for an all-out war), and a peacetime plan involving localized provocations from North Korea. OPLAN 5015 is suspected to call for preemptive strikes on the North\u2019s essential military facilities and weapons, and possibly North Korean leadership.\u000a\u000aIn the event that a nuclear missile strike appeared imminent, allied forces might attempt to eliminate the North\u2019s missiles at launch. Mike Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last year that the U.S. could move to \u201ctake out launch capabilities on the launchpad\u201d if North Korea appeared poised to launch a nuclear armed-missile.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. and South Korea regularly train for such contingencies. For example, during the annual Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises, U.S. and South Korean troops practice a \u201c4D\u201d operational plan which involves preemptive military options to detect, disrupt, destroy, and defend against North Korean strikes. The focus is precision strikes on the enemy\u2019s core military facilities and weapons systems.\u000a\u000aThe challenge is that more and more of North Korea\u2019s missiles are on mobile launchers and scattered about the country. Furthermore, the Korean People\u2019s Army (KPA) has started using solid-fueled missiles, which require significantly less preparation time as they can be fueled in advance and need only a limited crew. Solid-fueled missiles can be fired with less warning and are much harder to track, making them less vulnerable to preemptive strikes.\u000a\u000aAnother issue is that preemptive strikes on North Korea would be much harder to justify diplomatically, especially if war breaks out in the aftermath, which is practically guaranteed.\u000a\u000aWhat If The Nukes Are Already In The Air?\u000a\u000aIf a North Korean missile makes it into the air, there are plans for that situation as well.\u000a\u000aStage two of South Korea\u2019s three-stage defense system is the Korea Air and Missile Defense (KAMD) system, which is designed to intercept incoming missiles. The U.S. is bolstering South Korean defense through the deployment of a THAAD battery to South Korea, a process that began after North Korea fired four missiles into the Sea of Japan a few weeks ago.\u000a\u000aTHAAD\u2019s Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveillance (AN/TYP-2) X-band radar can be configured to one of two settings: forward-base mode and terminal mode. In the latter, the radar has a range of several hundred miles and can facilitate the elimination of missiles in the terminal phase of flight. In the former, the radar\u2019s range is extended, making it possible for THAAD to target projectiles in the initial or launch phase.\u000a\u000aTo ease China\u2019s concerns about the radar\u2019s ability to peer into its territory, the U.S. has agreed to configure THAAD in terminal mode. China continues to express opposition to the deployment.\u000a\u000aTHAAD is an important step for South Korean missile defense.\u000a\u000a\u201cTHAAD is better than anything South Korea has or will have for decades,\u201d Bruce Klingner, who specializes in Korean and Japanese affairs as the senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation, told TheDCNF, \u201cIt is imperative that we deploy it to augment the defense of Korea and the U.S. forces deployed there.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere are also a number of Aegis destroyers operating in the waters off of South Korea. The U.S. has several in the region; Japan has six, and South Korea has three. The Aegis ballistic missile system can track multiple missiles simultaneously and intercept enemy projectiles as needed.\u000a\u000aThere are certain gaps in South Korea\u2019s defense though. For starters, South Korea\u2019s KAMD is not incorporated into the broader allied defense system, thus weakening its overall effectiveness. Also, the South is particularly vulnerable to submarine-launched ballistic missiles, which the North successfully tested last year.\u000a\u000aJapan is much more \u201cforward leaning\u201d in its defense, Klingner notes. Japan has Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC)-2 and 3 systems, Aegis destroyers and SM-3 interceptors, and Japan is considering deploying THAAD and Aegis Ashore units on Japanese soil to boost national defense.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. has ground-based midcourse defense systems in Fort Greely, Alaska and Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.\u000a\u000aAnti-missile systems have their limitations though.\u000a\u000aKlingner remarked that \u201ccertainly, there is that possibility\u201d that a nuclear-armed ballistic missile could slip through allied defenses, especially given that most regional missile defense systems have never been tested in actual battle conditions.\u000a\u000a\u201cMissile defenses help reduce the threat, but they can\u2019t eliminate it,\u201d Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program in the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, commented.\u000a\u000aIn the simplest of terms, missile defense involves hitting a bullet with another bullet, which is no easy task.\u000a\u000a\u201cMissile defense systems will never provide 100 percent effectiveness \u2026 The addition of THAAD does not guarantee the protection of Seoul, but it does add another piece to the constantly changing puzzle of defense,\u201d Rodger Baker, Vice President of Strategic Analysis at Stratfor, a geopolitical intelligence platform, told TheDCNF.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea is rapidly developing the capabilities necessary to skirt allied ballistic missile defense systems.\u000a\u000a\u201cNorth Korea can probably build missiles (especially ER Scuds) faster and more cheaply than we can build and deploy defenses,\u201d Lewis noted. In recent weapons tests and military drills, North Korea has practiced firing off multiple missiles in rapid succession or simultaneously to overwhelm enemy missile defense systems.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a tactic called \u2018salvo fire,\u2019 which is designed to place greater stress on all types of ballistic missile defenses. I don\u2019t know how many simultaneous attacks it would take to \u2018saturate\u2019 the battle-management systems in use today by the U.S., South Korean, or Japanese militaries, but the North Koreans seem determined to refine their salvo capabilities,\u201d Joshua Pollack, editor of The Nonproliferation Review and senior research associate in the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, told TheDCNF. \u201cEven if it didn\u2019t succeed in saturating the defenses, it would at least more rapidly deplete the defense, which has a limited number of shots.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cEnough simultaneous launches could overwhelm the THAAD system and increase the risk of a nuclear-armed ballistic missile reaching its target in South Korea,\u201d Kelsey Davenport, director of Nonproliferation Policy at the Arms Control Institute, told TheDCNF after North Korea launched three missiles at the same time last September.\u000a\u000aThe simultaneous launch of multiple missiles is \u201cbasic missile defense countermeasure,\u201d Lewis told CNN. \u201cOne THAAD battery is not enough. We need at least two, if not many more,\u201d he told TheDCNF.
