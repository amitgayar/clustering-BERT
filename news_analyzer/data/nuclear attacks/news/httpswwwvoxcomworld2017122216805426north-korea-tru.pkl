VPresident Donald Trump spent 2017 mocking North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for being \u201cshort and fat,\u201d a \u201csick puppy,\u201d and \u201ca madman.\u201d For good measure, he repeatedly called Kim \u201cLittle Rocket Man.\u201d\u000a\u000aNone of that should distract from the fact that the North Korean dictator had a very, very good year.\u000a\u000aHe tested three missiles that can theoretically hit the mainland US, including one that could conceivably hit Washington, DC, or New York. His scientists appear to have overcome a major technical hurdle and created a nuclear weapon small enough to fit on top of one of those missiles, which means he could launch a nuclear attack against major American cities. His military tested its largest such bomb to date, one that was seven times stronger than the bomb America dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.\u000a\u000aAnd, as if that wasn\u2019t enough, his hackers launched a cyberattack that disabled hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries around the world.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a remarkable turnaround for Kim, who in March and April suffered repeated humiliations of seeing one of his missiles either explode just a few seconds after launch or barely reach their targets. Those failures raised real questions about whether his abilities to hit the US would ever match his harsh threats.\u000a\u000aBut Kim\u2019s achievements came at a high cost. The US and the United Nations have imposed harsh new sanctions on North Korea because of its nuclear and missile programs, including a measure on August 5 that prohibited some of North Korea\u2019s exports like iron and seafood. More than 20 countries restricted North Korea\u2019s diplomatic activities, including expelling its diplomats.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s contributed to the sheer suffering of most of Kim\u2019s country, which is already one of the world\u2019s poorest. A chilling report released earlier this month noted that North Korea\u2019s prisons are \u201cas terrible [as] Nazi camps,\u201d in part because guards sometimes roll logs down a mountain to kill prisoners. Four North Korean soldiers even defected across the border this year, the highest total in almost 20 years.\u000a\u000aWhen doctors treated one of them, they found a parasite in his stomach more than 10 inches long, showing that even Kim\u2019s military \u2014 which gets more food than ordinary civilians \u2014 is suffering from severe malnutrition.\u000a\u000aBut Kim \u2014 who prioritizes his weapons programs over anything else \u2014 likely won\u2019t mind. He is assuredly pleased with the progress his regime made in 2017. And North Korea experts I spoke to, like the Middlebury Institute of International Studies\u2019 Joshua Pollack, expect Kim will only look to improve his weapons even more in 2018.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, they\u2019re not done,\u201d he told me.\u000a\u000aKim got off to a rough start in 2017.\u000a\u000aHe ordered a missile test on March 22 in retaliation for a large-scale military exercise that the US and South Korea conducted earlier that month. The problem is the missile \u2014 which some experts believe was an intermediate-range weapon \u2014 barely made it off the launchpad and exploded within seconds. Had the test succeeded, it would\u2019ve shown that North Korea was closer to a functioning longer-range projectile.\u000a\u000aApril wasn\u2019t much better. On April 16, North Korea launched a missile that detonated shortly after it took off. A launch two weeks later went farther, but the missile didn\u2019t make it out of North Korean airspace.\u000a\u000aDespite the repeated failures, North Korea experts noted at the time that the weapons were still pretty advanced. \u201cThey\u2019re not just showing off missiles that are hard to build,\u201d Jeffrey Lewis, a North Korea and proliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute, told the New York Times in April. \u201cThey\u2019re showing off all the associated technologies you need for credible deployments,\u201d meaning that the missile\u2019s engine and other parts showed North Korea kept improving the weapon\u2019s design.\u000a\u000aThat all changed by the summer, when Kim started showing off weapons that were much more technologically advanced \u2014 and that seemingly worked as planned.\u000a\u000aOn July 4, North Korea successfully launched its first-ever intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Experts who studied it said the missile could theoretically hit all of Alaska. (North Korea usually shoots its longer-range missiles straight up so countries around it don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re under attack. Experts calculate the missile\u2019s reach based on how high up it flies and how far over it travels.)\u000a\u000aJust over three weeks later, Kim completed another ICBM test, showing he could potentially strike major US cities like New York or Washington. It was a significant advancement that showed North Korea\u2019s missile could go ever farther.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou usually see new missile systems encounter failures early on,\u201d Zachary Keck, a nuclear expert at the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, told me in July. However, \u201cNorth Korea tested many of its components on earlier missiles and worked out the kinks.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe UN Security Council \u2014 led by pressure from the Trump administration \u2014 imposed sanctions on North Korea on August 5 in retaliation for the ICBM launches. But Kim seemed emboldened by his recent successes. He went on to order two missile tests that flew over Japan \u2014 one on August 28 and the other on September 15. After the second test, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said: "We need to let North Korea realize that if they keep taking this path, they will have no bright future."\u000a\u000aNorth Korea didn\u2019t test a missile for the next two months. That wasn\u2019t so odd since Pyongyang rarely launches weapons in the winter months, partially due to bad weather. During the break, on November 20, Trump put North Korea back on the state sponsors of terrorism list \u2014 which, among other things, imposed even more sanctions on the country.\u000a\u000aA mere nine days later, North Korea launched its most powerful missile yet. It flew 10 times higher than the International Space Station, and experts said the missile could likely strike every part of the United States.\u000a\u000aTrump was infuriated by the missile tests, and threatened to unleash \u201cfire and fury\u201d against Pyongyang for its provocations. After all, on January 2 \u2014 weeks before becoming president \u2014 he promised that North Korea wouldn\u2019t test an ICBM under his watch. But Kim did on three separate occasions.\u000a\u000aKim responded by saying he would \u201csurely and definitely tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire.\u201d The war of words led some lawmakers to warn that there was a growing risk of actual war.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are far closer to actual conflict over North Korea than the American people realize,\u201d Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), an Iraq War veteran and Purple Heart recipient, told Vox\u2019s Zack Beauchamp.\u000a\u000aKim\u2019s improved missiles aren\u2019t the only reason he\u2019s had such a good year by his standards, though such a scary year for the rest of the world.\u000a\u000aOn September 3, a 6.3 magnitude earthquake registered inside North Korea. It turned out that Pyongyang had detonated a hydrogen bomb with at least a 100-kiloton yield, according to experts, which made the device around seven times stronger than the bomb America dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. It was North Korea\u2019s sixth nuclear test, and its first during the Trump administration.\u000a\u000aAs the chart below shows, it was also the country\u2019s largest nuclear test \u2014 by far.\u000a\u000a\u201cNorth Korea wants the ability to target the United States,\u201d Lewis told me after North Korea detonated the bomb in September. \u201cA thermonuclear weapon does more damage,\u201d he continued, using another name for a hydrogen bomb.\u000a\u000aAnd that bomb can do a lot of harm. Vipin Narang, a nuclear expert at MIT, told the Washington Post that the bomb meant the North \u201ccan destroy the better part of a city\u201d even if its long-range missiles were relatively inaccurate.\u000a\u000aDuring an interview with CBS\u2019s John Dickerson on April 30, Trump didn\u2019t rule out a military strike on North Korea if it tested a nuclear weapon.\u000a\u000aHe didn\u2019t attack after the September nuclear test, and it\u2019s unclear how he will respond if there is another one.\u000a\u000aThe US military now believes Kim already has a miniaturized nuclear weapon, which means the bomb is small enough to fit on top of a missile. But it\u2019s still unclear if Pyongyang can reliably fit the bomb atop the projectile and detonate it thousands of miles away. That\u2019s one of the hardest things for any nuclear program to do, but it\u2019s definitely not impossible.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, North Korean hackers are wreaking havoc around the world. On December 18, the US said North Korea was behind the WannaCry cyberattack. That attack used ransomware \u2014 where hackers use malware to scramble a victim\u2019s files and then demand money to unscramble them \u2014 to infect businesses, banks, hospitals, and schools in more than 150 countries. One of the biggest strikes occurred in Britain, where it caused havoc in the health care system and interfered with surgeries and emergency services.\u000a\u000aThis isn\u2019t the first time North Korea has launched a successful cyberattack. Experts and analysts believe the Kim regime was behind the $81 million cyber heist of the Bangladesh Central Bank in 2016 and the Sony Pictures hack in 2014 right before it released The Interview, a comedy about two Americans who assassinate Kim Jong Un. But WannaCry seems to be Kim\u2019s greatest cyber success to date.\u000a\u000aSo in addition to the missile program, Kim has demonstrated that his nuclear and cyber capabilities are also getting stronger. That\u2019s another reason 2017 has given him cause to celebrate.\u000a\u000aDespite Kim\u2019s personal wins, the North Korean people continue to suffer under his rule.\u000a\u000aTake the findings of an International Bar Association War Crimes Committee report released this month, which detailed the horrid conditions in North Korean prisons. Beauchamp, after reading the report, highlighted the horrifying realities for some of the approximately 80,000 and 130,000 North Korean prisoners:\u000a\u000a[Warning: the following descriptions are extremely disturbing]\u000a\u000aRecent pictures of the country\u2019s rural northeast highlight the country\u2019s crippling poverty. The CIA ranks North Korea as one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, and its people live on about $1,700 a year.\u000a\u000aEven North Korean troops, who are highly revered and respected in the country, struggle to live decent lives. Four of Kim\u2019s soldiers traversed the dangerous inter-Korean border to defect to South Korea this year, the highest total since 2000. In 2015, the Guardian noted how North Korean soldiers are forced to train on an empty stomach.\u000a\u000aAll of this serves to highlight the tragedy at the heart of Kim\u2019s very good year: Despite the sanctions and international pressure, he continues to spend about 22 percent of the country\u2019s GDP on its military. That doesn\u2019t leave much for improving the lives of his people.\u000a\u000aAnd so it appears that no matter what the international community does, North Korea will continue to focus on its weapons programs. As Van Jackson, an Asia security expert at Victoria University of Wellington, told me: \u201cWe can isolate them diplomatically, squeeze their economy, threaten them with nukes and regime change, point out how nukes undermine rather than bolster their security \u2014 and they just shake it off.\u201d\u000a\u000aNorth Korea is closer than ever to those goals. And if Kim gets them, which could be a matter of months, 2018 will be an even better year for the North Korean dictator. That\u2019s good news for him. It\u2019s terrible news for the rest of the world.
