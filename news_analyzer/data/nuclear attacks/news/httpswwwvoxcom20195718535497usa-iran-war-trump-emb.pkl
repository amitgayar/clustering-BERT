VThe United States seriously fears an imminent attack on its troops by Iran or its proxies. Iran signaled it may restart parts of its nuclear program in direct defiance of a landmark 2015 deal.\u000a\u000aIf tensions between Washington and Tehran were already high in the Trump era, they just increased substantially.\u000a\u000aStarting on Sunday, the Trump administration indicated it had credible intelligence that Iran and groups it supports in the Middle East might attack US personnel based there. Two days later, reports of Iran\u2019s specific plans surfaced: They apparently intended to target US troops in Iraq and Syria, or use drones against Americans in a key waterway near Yemen.\u000a\u000aA US defense official confirmed to me the existence of credible intelligence of specific Iranian threats, but wouldn\u2019t expand further.\u000a\u000aAs a result, the Trump administration has sent a US aircraft carrier and bombers to the region in an effort to deter an assault.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Iran is poised to announce on Wednesday that it will resume small parts of its nuclear program. That\u2019s a big deal: The 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the US, as well as some European countries, put tight restrictions on Tehran\u2019s nuclear efforts in exchange for sanctions relief. But on May 8, 2018 \u2014 exactly one year ago this Wednesday \u2014 President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the agreement, saying it only paved Iran\u2019s path to the bomb.\u000a\u000aIran abided by the deal even after Trump\u2019s announcement, but now it seems the most predictable scenario has come true: Tehran wants to kick-start its nuclear program once again.\u000a\u000aThis a fraught, delicate, and dangerous situation that could easily spiral out of control if not carefully managed in Washington and Tehran. Some experts are worried that cooler heads won\u2019t prevail.\u000a\u000a\u201cMoments like these are when institutions should matter: leadership at the cabinet level, a serious policy-making process, intelligence standards, professional ethics. All those have been eroded by the Trump administration,\u201d Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington, tweeted on Monday.\u000a\u000aIn a stunning Sunday statement, National Security Adviser John Bolton announced a military move by the US in response to what it says are Iranian threats. It\u2019s worth reading his short message in its entirety:\u000a\u000aActing Pentagon chief Patrick Shanahan added his own warnings the next day, saying the decision to send those weapons to the Middle East \u201crepresents a prudent repositioning of assets in response to indications of a credible threat by Iranian regime forces. ... We call on the Iranian regime to cease all provocation.\u201d\u000a\u000aThough it might seem sudden, an escalation like this was always possible.\u000a\u000aUS-Iranian relations, which have historically been pretty bad, tanked even further when America left the nuclear deal last year and reimposed tough sanctions on the country.\u000a\u000aLast month, the Trump administration took things a step further when they decided to label the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps \u2014 Iran\u2019s hugely influential security and military organization responsible for the protection and survival of the regime \u2014 as a \u201cforeign terrorist organization.\u201d That\u2019s the first time the US named any part of another government as terrorists.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s therefore not a surprise to some analysts that Iran is apparently considering retaliating in a severe manner. \u201cTo counterattack in response to pressure is a standard part of the Iranian playbook,\u201d Maloney also tweeted on Monday.\u000a\u000aPhillip Smyth, an Iran expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told me that major threats from Tehran\u2019s proxies have continued since early 2018. \u201cThere have been maneuvers in the past that sent a signal to the Americans\u201d of a worsening regional situation, he said.\u000a\u000aBut he noted that just because there are indications that an attack could happen doesn\u2019t mean an Iranian proxy will launch one soon. \u201cThese guys are very smart and very patient with how they plan and execute,\u201d he continued.\u000a\u000aStill, the intelligence is worrying. \u201cThere has definitely been an uptick in threat reporting directed at the US embassy in Iraq,\u201d an unnamed American official told Politico on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s more than we\u2019ve seen in a long time, and it suggests the de facto moratorium on attacks on US facilities by Iranian sponsored groups is fraying.\u201d The US currently has about 5,200 troops in the country.\u000a\u000aThis may explain why Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, the top US military officer for the Middle East, requested additional military assets in the region after reading intelligence of Iranian provocations. Shanahan authorized the request, expediting the USS Abraham Lincoln\u2019s preplanned trip to the Middle East along with B-52 bombers.\u000a\u000aIf it seems like gunboat diplomacy, it\u2019s because it is. The hope is that the move \u2014 which brings the US and Iran closer to a military fight \u2014 isn\u2019t the opening salvo in a broader war.\u000a\u000aIran is about to add more fuel to the fire.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is expected to announce small steps to resume his country\u2019s nuclear program. According to the New York Times, that will include conducting research on centrifuges that can make nuclear fuel, and curbing nuclear inspections from observers.\u000a\u000aThose moves by themselves don\u2019t really get the country closer to obtaining the bomb \u2014 but the timing is quite symbolic.\u000a\u000aRouhani\u2019s decree will come exactly one year after Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal, which experts say blocked Tehran\u2019s path to the bomb for at least a decade \u2014 if not more. It also comes weeks after the US said it would impose sanctions on all countries that import Iranian oil, the regime\u2019s main source of income. That was a big blow to Iran and to European nations that previously received waivers for such transactions to soften the aftereffects of leaving the nuclear accord.\u000a\u000aSo there are likely two main reasons Iran decided to make this move. First, Tehran sees no real benefit in staying in the deal anymore, and Iran\u2019s leaders think they may as well restart their nuclear work. And second, it serves as a big middle finger to the Trump administration in the midst of its maximum pressure campaign.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Islamic Republic of Iran in reaction to the exit of America from the nuclear deal and the bad promises of European countries in carrying out their obligations will restart a part of the nuclear activities which were stopped under the framework of the nuclear deal,\u201d an Iranian official told the state-run IRIB news agency on Monday.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s also possible that Iran will anger European governments that are participating in the deal if it restarts its nuclear work, thereby eroding any remaining trust in the accord.\u000a\u000aAll put together, it sure seems like the US and Iran won\u2019t diffuse the situation anytime soon. That means it could conceivably get worse \u2014 and quickly.
