VUS, British and other nuclear weapons systems are increasingly vulnerable to cyber attacks, according to a new study by the international relations thinktank Chatham House.\u000a\u000aThe threat has received scant attention so far from those involved in nuclear military planning and the procurement of weapons, the report said.\u000a\u000aIt blames this partly on failure to keep up with fast-moving advances, lack of skilled staff and the slowness of institutional change.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cNuclear weapons systems were developed before the advancement of computer technology and little consideration was given to potential cyber vulnerabilities. As a result, current nuclear strategy often overlooks the widespread use of digital technology in nuclear systems,\u201d the authors of the study said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNuclear weapons systems are at threat from hostile states, criminal groups and terrorist organisations exploiting cyber vulnerabities.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe likelihood of attempted cyber-attacks on nuclear weapons systems is relatively high and increasing from advanced persistent threats from states and non-state groups,\u201d the report said.\u000a\u000aIt cited examples such as a report the US could have infiltrated the supply chain of North Korea\u2019s missile system that contributed to a test failure in April last year. The silos of US nuclear-tipped Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles \u201care believed to be particularly vulnerable to cyber attacks\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe study also recorded illicit trafficking in Moldova and Georgia of radioactive and nuclear materials; a group in Belgium affiliated to Islamic State monitoring the movements of a nuclear scientist; and German-owned Patriot missiles reported to have been hacked in 2015.\u000a\u000aThe report, Cybersecurity of Nuclear Weapons Systems: Threats, Vulnerabilities and Consequences, was written by Beyza Unal, a research fellow at London-based Chatham House who previously worked on strategic analysis at Nato, and Patricia Lewis, research director of the international security department at Chatham House.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are a number of vulnerabilities and pathways through which a malicious actor may infiltrate a nuclear weapons system without a state\u2019s knowledge,\u201d the report said. \u201cHuman error, systems failures, design vulnerabilities and susceptibilities within the supply chain all represent common security issues in nuclear weapons systems.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe authors noted there is a dilemma between needing the private sector in order to keep up with advances in technology and the risks they bring with them.\u000a\u000a\u201cMany aspects of nuclear weapons development and systems management are privatised in the US and in the UK, potentially introducing a number of private-sector supply chain vulnerabilities.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt added: \u201cPresently, this is a relatively ungoverned space and these vulnerabilities could serve to undermine the overall integrity of national nuclear weapons systems. For example, the backdoors in software that companies often maintain to fix bugs and patch systems are targets for cyber-attacks once they are discovered and become known.\u201d\u000a\u000aPotential artificial intelligence (AI) applications, while creating new opportunities for cybersecurity, add another layer of complexity for nuclear weapons that could be exploited.\u000a\u000aThe authors criticise military failures to \u2013 so far \u2013 take the issue seriously. \u201cMilitary procurement programmes tend not to pay adequate consideration to emerging cyber risks \u2013 particularly to the supply chain \u2013 regardless of the government regulations for protecting data against cyber attacks. This could be due to constantly lagging behind the fast-moving nature of cyber attacks, a lack of skilled personnel and the slow institutional and organisational implementation of changes.\u201d\u000a\u000aDigital components, material and software can quickly become obsolete and, without proper updates and patching, \u201cthey are subject to intrusion\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe authors cite the UK\u2019s new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, which appeared to be using the same version of Windows in its control room at the outdated system that left the NHS exposed in the WannaCry ransomware attack in May last year.
