VNorth Korea has warned that the unprecedented deployment of three US aircraft carrier groups \u201ctaking up a strike posture\u201d around the Korean peninsula is making it impossible to predict when nuclear war will break out.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea's UN ambassador, Ja Song-nam, said in a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that the joint military exercises with South Korea are creating \u201cthe worst ever situation prevailing in and around the Korean peninsula.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlong with the three carrier groups, he said, the US has reactivated round-the-clock sorties with nuclear-capable B-52 strategic bombers \u201cwhich existed during the Cold War times.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe also said the US is maintaining \u201ca surprise strike posture with frequent flights of B-1B and B-2 formations to the airspace of South Korea.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe large-scale nuclear war exercises and blackmails, which the US staged for a whole year without a break in collaboration with its followers to stifle our republic, make one conclude that the option we have taken was the right one and we should go along the way to the last,\u201d Ja said.\u000a\u000aHe didn't elaborate on what \u201cthe last\u201d might be, but North Korea has launched ballistic missiles that have the potential to strike the US mainland, and it recently conducted its largest-ever underground nuclear explosion. It has also threatened to explode another nuclear bomb above the Pacific Ocean.\u000a\u000aThe four-day joint naval exercises by the US and South Korea, which began Saturday in waters off the South's eastern coast, were described by military officials as a clear warning to North Korea. They involve the carrier battle groups of the USS Ronald Reagan, Theodore Roosevelt and Nimitz, which include 11 US Aegis ships that can track missiles, and seven South Korean naval vessels.\u000a\u000aSeoul's military said in a statement that the exercises aim to enhance the combined US and South Korean operational and aerial strike capabilities and to display \u201cstrong will and firm military readiness to defeat any provocation by North Korea with dominant force in the event of crisis.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to the US Navy's 7th Fleet, it is the first time since a 2007 exercise near Guam that three US carrier strike groups have operated together in the western Pacific.\u000a\u000aUS Defence Secretary Jim Mattis insisted on Monday that the carrier manoeuvres are not extraordinary.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere's no big message\u201d intended for North Korea or anyone else, he told reporters in an impromptu exchange in a Pentagon hallway. \u201cThis is what we normally do with allies.\u201d\u000a\u000aReminded that it had been 10 years since the last three-carrier exercise, Mattis noted that the Navy has a limited number of carriers and can't often put three in the same place.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt's just a normal operation,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe military drills come amid US President Donald Trump's visit to Asia, which has been dominated by discussions over the North Korean nuclear threat.\u000a\u000aJa accused the UN Security Council in Monday's letter of repeatedly \u201cturning a blind eye to the nuclear war exercises of the United States, who is hell bent on bringing a catastrophic disaster to humanity.\u201d He said the exercises raise serious concern about \u201cthe double standard\u201d of the UN's most powerful body.\u000a\u000aHe also referenced Trump's September speech to the UN General Assembly in which the president said that if the US is \u201cforced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump tweeted soon after making the speech that Korea's leadership \u201cwon't be around much longer\u201d if it continued its provocations, a declaration that led the North's foreign minister to assert that Trump had \u201cdeclared war on our country.\u201d\u000a\u000aJa said Monday the US \u201cis now running amok for war exercises by introducing nuclear war equipment in and around the Korean peninsula, thereby proving that the US itself is the major offender of the escalation of tension and undermining of the peace.\u201d\u000a\u000aJa asked Guterres to circulate the letter to the Security Council and the General Assembly, and also asked him to use his power under Article 99 of the UN Charter to bring to the Security Council's attention \u201cthe danger being posed by the US nuclear war exercises which are clearly threats to international peace and security.\u201d
