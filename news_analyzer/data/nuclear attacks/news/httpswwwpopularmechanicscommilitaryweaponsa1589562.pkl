VWe\u2019ve seen what North Korea can do, and even though it hasn\u2019t been in the news lately, the experts we consulted say that terrorists are still trying to get dirty bombs into the country. The threat of a nuclear attack on the United States is higher than it\u2019s been since Berlin had a wall down its center. But what would that attack entail? What kind of damage would a nuclear bomb cause, and what, if anything, could we do to get ready for it?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. The initial shock wave lessens after the first ring, but will still demolish most residential buildings and cause widespread casualties.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a2. The fireball created by a nuclear bomb can reach tens of millions of degrees.\u000a\u000a3. The blast sends a shock wave that would destroy nearly everyone and everything within this first ring.\u000a\u000a4. If the bomb is detonated in the air, as opposed to on the ground, 50% to 90% of people in this area will die from radiation exposure without medical treatment.\u000a\u000a5. With a 10- kiloton bomb, everyone within the outermost ring in the image above would receive third-degree burns from thermal radiation.\u000a\u000aTerrorists: According to Jeff Schlegelmilch, deputy director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, the most likely nuclear weapon will be trucked in and exploded on the ground. He estimates its yield at 10 to 15 kilotons\u2014the same as Hiroshima. \u201cThis type of threat is very survivable,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be bad, but the republic would survive.\u201d\u000a\u000aNorth Korea: For a long time, North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat was capped in the 10- to 15-kiloton range. But earlier this year, says Michael Elleman, senior fellow for missile defense at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and an analyst for 38 North, a North Korea-tracking site, \u201cNorth Korea detonated a thermonuclear weapon with a yield ranging between 150 kilotons and 250 kilotons. The tested weapon very likely could be fit on the HS-15,\u201d the ICBM the country tested in November, \u201cwhich could reach most, if not all, of the U.S. mainland.\u201d\u000a\u000aFireball: Whether the nuke is detonated in the air or on the ground, the initial threat is the fireball, which can reach tens of millions of degrees. \u201cIf you\u2019re within that, you\u2019re dead,\u201d Schlegel­milch says. According to an online simulation created by Alex Wellerstein at the Stevens Institute of Technology (it\u2019s interactive, scary, and fun), a 10-kiloton bomb would produce a fireball with a radius of 500 to 650 feet.\u000a\u000aShock wave: After the fireball comes the shock wave, or air blast. If detonated in the air, that same 10-kiloton bomb would destroy most buildings and kill nearly everyone within 0.38 miles of ground zero. The effect is reduced by 23 percent if the detonation occurs on the ground. The shock wave weakens from there, but can still take out residential buildings and cause mass casualties two to two and a half times the initial spread of the shock wave, according to Wellerstein\u2019s projections.\u000a\u000aRadiation: If you survive the fireball and shock wave, now you have to avoid the radiation. Exposure within three quarters of a mile of that 10-kiloton bomb, Wellerstein shows, will kill up to 90 percent of people without medical treatment. For a quarter-mile past that, your chances of survival increase, but you\u2019ll get third-degree burns, which you probably won\u2019t feel, because the radiation also kills your pain receptors.\u000a\u000aFallout: If the attack comes from the ground, dirt and debris are irradiated and shot into the air by the explosion, forming the classic mushroom cloud. Winds can carry the radiation, called nuclear fallout, from that cloud tens or hundreds of miles away, depending on the size of the bomb and the strength of the wind. As it falls back to earth, it sickens more people.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe good news is, if you make it through the blast and shock wave, you are now in a survivable situation,\u201d Schlegelmilch says. If you\u2019re close to the blast you need to get to a shelter. \u201cAt best, you have 15 to 20 minutes before the fallout starts to come back down,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re farther out, you could have more time, but the reality is, you aren\u2019t going to have time to evaluate the situation. If you see a nuclear flash, the first thing to do is get behind a barrier in case the shock wave comes. Then get to the inner part of a building. Ideally you\u2019d be protected by thick concrete, underground if possible. Glass and most metals won\u2019t provide you much protection.\u201d If the explosion was ground based, you can also protect yourself by getting above the blast\u2014usually higher than the ninth floor of a building. Be sure to stay near the center of the building in a room with substantial walls.\u000a\u000aIf you somehow get stuck outside and think fallout is falling around you, cover your nose and mouth with a rag and close your eyes. Get to shelter immediately, where you should remove your outer layer of clothing, including that rag you just held over your face, and double seal it in plastic bags. Take a shower as soon as possible.\u000a\u000aThe danger of fallout is relatively short-lived. The Department of Homeland Security says that radioactivity is reduced by 90 percent after seven hours. Two days later, only 1 percent of the original radiation remains. Still, maybe stay in that shelter for one more day. Just to be safe.\u000a\u000aRoughly 15 percent of the energy released in the initial blast and fallout of an atomic bomb is high-frequency ionizing radiation. Unlike other forms of radiation, such as visible light and microwaves, ionizing radiation is fast and energetic enough to strip electrons from molecules, including the ones that make up the cells in your body. That radiation randomly damages the DNA in your cells\u2014as if you\u2019ve been shot with millions of tiny pins. (UV rays are borderline ionizing, which is why you can get skin cancer from tanning.) If ionizing radiation strips enough electrons from your DNA, or if you\u2019re unlucky and it hits the wrong places in your genome, the genes that control cell growth can start to function abnormally. Certain cells divide out of control, causing tumors, leukemias, or other cancers. The risk is particularly high for children, whose cells have divided less often and are more likely to run amok if damaged.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBrighter colors reflect more radiation. Not so much more that it\u2019ll really matter, but it might make you feel a little better.\u000a\u000aYou probably shouldn\u2019t choose real estate based on the chances of a nuclear attack, but if it comes down to two places and you can\u2019t decide? Go with the one in the area that\u2019s less likely to have nuclear fallout carried to it by prevailing winds. In the New York City area, that\u2019s New Jersey. You can find a map of the prevailing winds in your area at hint.fm. They\u2019re strangely beautiful.\u000a\u000aAirburst: A nuclear weapon detonated in the air to maximize destructive capabilities. Since the blast comes from above, it is less contained by buildings around it.\u000a\u000aAtomic bomb: A bomb powered by nuclear fission, the splitting of atoms. Most atomic bombs are rated in kilotons\u2014each of which is the equivalent of 1,000 tons of TNT.\u000a\u000aFallout: When a nuclear explosion occurs at ground level, the blast blows bits of dirt and debris into the air, where they become radioactive and are carried by the winds before falling back down to earth.\u000a\u000aGround burst: A nuclear weapon detonated on the ground. It causes less widespread destruction than an airburst, but releases fallout.\u000a\u000aHydrogen bomb: Also called a thermonuclear weapon, this type of bomb is much more powerful than an atomic bomb. It\u2019s actually set off by an atomic bomb, and gets its power from the resulting nuclear fusion, the combining of atoms. Most hydrogen bombs are rated in megatons, the equivalent of 1,000 kilotons.\u000a\u000aICBM: A missile that can travel thousands of miles by exiting Earth\u2019s atmosphere, hitting suborbital space, and reentering the atmosphere. Most commonly used in the delivery of nuclear weapons.\u000a\u000aPrevailing winds: Air currents over a particular area that typically flow in the same direction.\u000a\u000aThis appears in the March 2018 issue\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWant more Popular Mechanics?
