VFor the bulk of my professional career, I\u2019ve been studying maybe the most difficult and dangerous question in American foreign policy: how to handle a North Korea armed with nuclear weapons. During five of those years, my job at the Department of Defense was anything but academic. I was at the center of the Pentagon\u2019s efforts to wrap our heads around what to do in a crisis; as part of that work, I advised Pentagon leadership through two real-world crises in 2010, and spent the years that followed figuring out how to prevent or overcome future North Korean attacks. The nature of the work inhibits me from talking about particulars. But suffice it to say we examined the problem from every imaginable angle, from how to prevail in traditional war scenarios at an acceptable cost to how the U.S. military would manage the sudden collapse of the North Korean regime. Meanwhile, the task of managing North Korea has grown only more difficult as the country has advanced toward being able to hit the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile.\u000a\u000aNow, I\u2019m getting nightmare flashbacks as I read the fragmentary reports dribbling out in the media about what seems like an intense debate inside the Trump administration. A recent story in the Wall Street Journal suggests that some on the Trump team have floated the idea of giving a \u201cbloody nose\u201d to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The action would be a preventive, limited attack on a North Korean missile facility, nuclear facility or missile launch site. The purported aim of giving Kim a bloody nose would be to \u201cillustrate the high price the regime could pay for its behavior,\u201d according to the Journal.\u000a\u000aAdvocates of the bloody nose strategy are willing to make a bet: that if the U.S. attacks the North in an unprovoked but limited way, Kim will not retaliate with violence in kind\u2014or worse. This assumption amounts to a sucker\u2019s bet, and the price will be mass casualties. Hundreds of thousands of people could die.\u000a\u000aTo explain why a bloody nose is bound to cause a bloody war, I could point to reams of academic research, including evidence that shows states with small nuclear arsenals and conventional military inferiority have strong incentives to respond to an attack by launching nuclear first strikes. I could describe how unprovoked attacks create reputations for hostility but not resolve, making it a poor way of trying to teach an adversary a lesson. I could even highlight research that suggests attacking nuclear facilities only accelerates, not retards, a state\u2019s scramble for nuclear weapons.\u000a\u000aBut scholarly knowledge can seem esoteric, and at any rate the Trump administration is normalizing the idea of a \u201cbloody nose\u201d attack against North Korea despite the mass of expert opinion counseling against it. So perhaps the most persuasive way to illustrate the utter folly of this fringe concept would be to engage in momentary strategic empathy with Kim and the situation in which he would find himself in the immediate aftermath of U.S. strikes. To truly understand Kim, we need to imagine what it\u2019s like to be him.\u000a\u000aFirst, let\u2019s walk through the scenario and choices facing North Korea\u2019s supreme leader. As you\u2019ll see, there is no beneficial outcome to be had, and the downside ranges from a cycle of local retaliatory violence to outright nuclear war targeting U.S. territory\u2014and once we\u2019ve attacked, that choice rests mostly with Kim, not with us.\u000a\u000aIf the United States aims to teach North Korea a lesson, as the Journal\u2019s reporting suggests, it needs the attack to be public, which should rule out using special forces or clandestine means of destruction. The ideal target for sending a message to Pyongyang would also be the hardest to hit\u2014a mobile missile, fired from a \u201ctransporter-erector-launcher.\u201d Mobile targets are elusive, and made more so by North Korea\u2019s recent use of solid fuel, which gives fewer advance indicators of a pending missile launch.\u000a\u000aSuccessfully striking a mobile target located far from the South Korean border would show that no target in North Korea is out of reach of U.S. power projection, though in fairness, not even North Korea doubts what the United States is capable of; the hypothetical benefit of a demonstration strike is not in revealing U.S. capability but rather U.S. willingness to impose costs on Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aBecause most of North Korea\u2019s missile sites are located in the northernmost parts of North Korea, a U.S. strike would most likely occur by sea or by air. By sea, the most sensible weapon would be what the Trump administration used to conduct strikes against Syria in April last year\u2014the Tomahawk Land-Attack Cruise Missile, fired from one of the many surface ships the U.S. Navy has patrolling in international waters off North Korea\u2019s coasts. By air, the F-22 and F-35, flown in stealth mode, are the aircraft with the least risk of being shot down by North Korea\u2019s network of surface-to-air missile sites.\u000a\u000aWhether by sea or by air, the United States would take precautions to maximize the chances of success and minimize damage to the U.S. weapons system by, for example, conducting electronic jamming of North Korean command and control, or destroying secondary targets like air defenses. In the name of self-protection, minutes before the missiles hit, Kim would know that something was up.\u000a\u000aNow for the morbid and unsettling part. If the United States attacked a North Korean missile site, Kim\u2019s immediate challenge would be trying to determine in real time whether the United States just launched a full-blown war.\u000a\u000aKeeping in mind that North Korean hackers stole alliance war plans last year, Kim will look for specific indicators to quickly render this judgment. He\u2019s likely to ask a series of logical questions:\u000a\u000a\u2022 Are North Korean radars, communications, or computer networks being jammed or disrupted?\u000a\u000a\u2022 Are North Korea\u2019s \u201cstrategic assets\u201d\u2014which includes its missiles and nuclear facilities\u2014being targeted?\u000a\u000a\u2022 Is a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group in the vicinity of the Korean Peninsula?\u000a\u000a\u2022 Are U.S. nuclear-capable bombers present in Korea or Japan?\u000a\u000a\u2022 Has there been a U.S. troop buildup in the region?\u000a\u000a\u2022 Do U.S. rhetorical statements accommodate the possibility of it launching war?\u000a\u000a\u2022 Are American civilians being evacuated from South Korea?\u000a\u000aIn conjunction with a U.S. first strike, only one of these seven questions needs to be answered affirmatively for Kim to presume that a war has begun, and the more that are answered \u201cyes,\u201d the more confident (and swift) he\u2019ll be in that judgment\u2014with devastating consequences.\u000a\u000aAs of now, a U.S. bloody nose attack would occur in a context in which the answer to the first six of these seven questions would indeed be \u201cyes\u201d (and the hawkish Republican Senator Lindsey Graham has urged a \u201cyes\u201d on the seventh question, too). Let me explain what I mean. Aircraft carriers and nuclear-capable bombers have become common features of U.S. military posture in Korea, just as they would if the United States were preparing to prosecute a war. The nature of a preventive strike would be to specifically target a North Korean missile site or nuclear facility, both of which are strategic assets. Trump administration officials\u2014and especially Trump himself\u2014have not simply left military options on the table, but actively and repeatedly threatened war. And, as a means of minimizing operational risk to the weapons platform delivering the strike, the U.S. military as a matter of procedure would probably engage in electronic and cyber warfare, disabling the enemy\u2019s countermeasures as much as possible.\u000a\u000aMind you, this is for the most limited and isolated of preventive strikes, against a single target. If the United States were conducting additional attacks, or destroying North Korean air defenses, Kim\u2019s war-decision problem becomes automatic.\u000a\u000aIf Kim concluded that war were imminent, or that it had already begun, he would have no choice but to launch a devastating retaliatory response in hopes that it raises the stakes of conflict enough to cause the United States to back off. There\u2019s added urgency, too: The more time passes at the start of a conflict, the greater the military disadvantage facing North Korea. So Kim won\u2019t want to unnecessarily trigger a war himself, but as soon as he\u2019s concluded the war is on, he must take drastic action immediately to maximize his chances of survival.\u000a\u000aThat immediate drastic action does not inevitably take the form of nuclear attacks, but the likelihood that it does is exceedingly high. Why? Because, facing the \u201cfact\u201d of war, Kim has multiple reinforcing incentives to launch a nuclear strike immediately. Nukes are Kim\u2019s \u201cace in the hole\u201d; if he doesn\u2019t play them immediately, the U.S. might eliminate them in a first-wave attack. That\u2019s the use-or-lose incentive for nuclear first strikes. And the reason he would use them at all follows what nuclear strategists call the Pakistan model\u2014deliberately escalating to nuclear use in a crisis to strike fear into the enemy sufficient to induce restraint in them.\u000a\u000aThe targets at which Kim would immediately aim\u2014whether with nuclear warheads or conventional missiles\u2014are likely those that would make it harder for the U.S. and its allies to prosecute a war\u2014the port of Pusan at the southernmost tip of South Korea, U.S. air bases or ports in Japan, or even Guam (home to U.S. nuclear bombers) and Hawaii (home to U.S. Pacific Command headquarters). We know this because North Korea has claimed it would strike such targets in the past, it\u2019s consistent with what we expect from North Korean military strategy, and, if Kim wants to maximize the political advantage from his nuclear weapons, he needs to use them early in a conflict to blunt America\u2019s ability to project power.\u000a\u000aNorth Korean retaliation with nuclear strikes becomes even more thinkable because Kim can now conduct such strikes while holding the U.S. homeland hostage with intercontinental ballistic missiles as well as Seoul with artillery and rockets, thousands of which are within striking distance of the vulnerable South Korean capital. Kim would be sane for believing that by not turning Seoul into a \u201csea of fire\u201d and not striking the continental United States but still raising the costs of hostilities with limited missile attacks against military targets, he could force the United States into suing for peace or otherwise backing down. Because if the United States refused to back down at that point, he could credibly threaten to attack the United States proper, or destroy Seoul.\u000a\u000aOnce North Korea launches missiles against U.S. and ally military targets, the body count will clear 100,000 in a matter of hours if those missiles have nuclear warheads mounted on them. And that\u2019s a conservative estimate. Even strikes with conventional warheads would produce tens of thousands of casualties.\u000a\u000aIf any of this sounds suicidal and therefore implausible, it\u2019s because you\u2019re imagining all this going down in a peacetime context. If Kim concludes war has come\u2014which he has every reason to do given the indicators above\u2014he\u2019s staring down death and the end of his family dynasty. In war, moves that might seem suicidal are actually those with the best chance of scaring the adversary into de-escalation of conflict.\u000a\u000aThe Alternate Scenario: What if Kim Recognizes the Bloody Nose for What It Is?\u000a\u000aAdvocates of the bloody nose theory believe that Kim won\u2019t conclude that a single attack amounts to war despite the numerous indicators above that suggest he would. They\u2019re wrong, but suppose a best-case scenario for the bloody-nosers\u2014that Kim errs on the side of caution and decides that a U.S. preventive attack is not a war-launching action. Even then, though, there\u2019s a second problem that directly undermines the bloody-nose assumptions\u2014for reasons of domestic politics and strategic culture, Kim must respond to violence with violence. It\u2019s hard to imagine he would just hunker down and take it, as Syria\u2019s Bashar Assad did after Trump ordered airstrikes in response to his regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons.\u000a\u000aKim leads a military and policy elite with a very specific set of beliefs about the utility of force and how the country has managed to survive\u2014by responding to pressure with pressure, by resorting to brinkmanship in times of crisis, and by launching occasional unprovoked, limited attacks at times and places of its choosing. Pressure-for-pressure and deterrence-through-aggression have been North Korea\u2019s modus operandi since the 1960s and endures today.\u000a\u000aThis highly aggressive strategic culture stems from the country\u2019s history of being overrun by outside great powers, as well as concluding from the history of its rivalry with the United States that deliberate friction through provocations was the reason the United States hadn\u2019t invaded Pyongyang. If Kim recognizes a limited attack as being limited, then he\u2019s less likely to launch nuclear strikes but much more likely to launch a retaliatory campaign of violence at a time and place of his choosing. To do otherwise would open him to charges of weakness and risk a coup d\u2019état that ousts him from power.\u000a\u000aAnd that\u2019s the best-case scenario\u2014ceding the initiative for future military conflict to North Korea by forcing it to plan and execute a military campaign that grants Pyongyang maximum advantage. Bloodying Kim\u2019s nose guarantees that, at minimum, North Korea will develop a military campaign that wreaks bloody havoc on its terms, in a manner that makes it hard for the United States to prevent or even respond. It launched such campaigns repeatedly in the 1960s, and it has an office today (the Reconnaissance General Bureau) dedicated to planning guerilla-style attacks, special operations raids and even terrorist actions.\u000a\u000aSeveral important factors distinguish how and why North Korea would respond differently to being attacked than Assad did in April 2017, or Saddam Hussein when Israel attacked his nuclear reactor in 1981. Kim is ensconced in a strategic culture that doesn\u2019t meaningfully distinguish between a bloody nose and an invasion. Kim has nuclear weapons; they didn\u2019t. Kim has positioned artillery and rockets to continuously hold at risk a capital city with 9 million people; neither Assad nor Saddam had any such military leverage. And Kim runs a country that\u2019s on a war footing toward the U.S., while Assad and Saddam weren\u2019t.\u000a\u000aThe United States has been a sworn enemy of North Korea for more than 70 years. Given the circumstances, Kim would find it difficult to tell the difference between a limited strike out of the blue and the opening salvo of a war. Even if he could, there is no way Kim and his advisers will accept a precedent of being bullied by its larger adversary, especially if they believe that adversary is pulling its punches to avoid war. A bloody nose attack is sheer folly, and Trump should reject the advice of those pushing him to do it.
