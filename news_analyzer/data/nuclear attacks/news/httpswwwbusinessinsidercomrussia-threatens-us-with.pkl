VRussia's military and state-sponsored media have reacted with a fire and fury of their own to the news that the US will exit the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaties, one of the last barriers to a full-on Cold War-like arms race in Europe - and there's already talk of a nuclear doomsday device visiting the US.\u000a\u000aThe INF treaty banned land-based nuclear capable missiles with a range between 300 and 3,200 miles in 1987 when Russia and the US had populated much of Europe with intermediate-ranged nuclear missiles. The ban eliminated this entire class of missiles and went down as one of the most successful acts of arms control ever.\u000a\u000aThe US and all of NATO concluded recently that Russia had spent years developing a banned nuclear-capable weapon, thereby making the treaty meaningless. The US responded by saying it would withdraw and design its own treaty-busting missiles. Russia said it would do the same, though many suspect they already have the missiles built.\u000a\u000aRead more: France fires nuclear-capable missile in a rare show as Russia and US feud over arms treaty\u000a\u000aBut Russia's response to the US didn't stop there.\u000a\u000aA BBC review of Russian newspapers, some state-owned and all adhering to state narratives or censored by the Kremlin, revealed some truly apocalyptic ideas.\u000a\u000a"If the Americans deploy their new missiles near Russia's borders, and in response we deploy ours, then of course, the risk of [nuclear] conflict rises sharply," an arms control expert told one paper.\u000a\u000a"If US missiles are deployed in Poland or the Baltic states, they'll be able to reach Russia in minutes. In such an event, the way Russia currently conceives using nuclear weapons, as a retaliatory strike, becomes impossible, since there won't be time to work out which missiles have been launched against Russia, what their trajectory and their targets are," he continued. "This is why there is now a temptation for both us and for them to adopt the doctrine of s preemptive strike."\u000a\u000aThis expert argues that the INF's demise means both the US and Russia now have to consider nuking the other at the first sign of conflict because missile attacks won't be as predictable as longer-range salvos from the continental US and Russia's mainland.\u000a\u000aBut the expert neglects to mention that US and Russian nuclear submarines can already fire from almost anywhere at sea, already confusing targets and trajectories and taking minutes to reach Russian forces.\u000a\u000aRead more: In a fiery warning to rivals, Putin says any country that nukes Russia will 'drop dead'\u000a\u000aFinally, Russian media turned to what's quickly becoming a propaganda crutch in communicating Moscow's might: The Doomsday device.\u000a\u000aRussia recently admitted to having built one of the more insane nuclear weapons of all time in the form of an undersea torpedo with a 100-megaton nuclear warhead that's designed to be unstoppable to all current missile defenses and create tsunami-sized waves and a radioactive hellstorm that stomps out life on earth for thousands of square miles for decades.\u000a\u000aRead more: Russia just showed off a potentially world-ending nuclear 'doomsday' torpedo that the US can't stop\u000a\u000aSince they announced the weapon, they've already used it to threaten Europe. But now with the INF treaty in tatters, a military expert told a Russian paper that the doomsday device could see use.\u000a\u000a"It cannot be excluded that one of the Poseidon with a 100 megaton nuclear warhead will lay low off the US coast, becoming 'the doomsday weapon.' Thus an attack on Russia, will become a suicidal misadventure," the paper states.\u000a\u000aThis paper also declined to mention that the US and Russia's current nuclear posture already guarantees any mutual nuclear exchanges would lead to the total destruction of either country.\u000a\u000aRead more: A new Russian video may show a 'doomsday machine' able to trigger 300-foot tsunamis - but nuclear weapons experts question why you'd ever build one\u000a\u000aRussia's Poseidon doomsday device doesn't change the mutually assured destruction dynamic between the Washington and Moscow, it only provides a way to destroy more natural life in the process.\u000a\u000aRussia's media may swerve into bombast, but Russia's actual military has already announced plans to build more weapons and extend the range of current weapons to counter the US in what experts peg as the next great nuclear standoff.
